Chapter 1: What is Manipulation? If you could force people to obey you, would you do it? If you could force the hand of someone else, even though you knew that they did not want to do what you were asking, would you be willing to do so? Perhaps you really need to borrow $5000 for a down payment on a car, but your parents are unwilling to give it to you. Maybe you really want to borrow your friend’s new motorcycle to experiment on it, but they are reluctant because you do not have a license. How likely are you to make it a point to move forward? What if your friend is in a relationship with someone who is abusive or just not right for her? Would you do anything in your power to convince her to end the relationship? All of that and more is possible with the power of manipulation. When you are able to manipulate people, you are effectively managing to influence the mind of the other person. You are able to figure out how best to control the other person and ensure that you can, in fact, take over once and for all. You can use your understanding of the other person’s mind in order to get them to do just about anything. If you can play your cards right, you can covertly access the mind of someone else, install all of the right strings, and play the other person like a puppet. This skill can be incredibly useful to you if you know what you are doing. You can figure out how best to take control of the mind of someone else. You can convince them to do your bidding, whether for your own or their own benefit. This chapter will introduce you to manipulation as a concept. You will learn how manipulation works as a concept. Lastly, you will be provided with several examples of types of manipulation that you may encounter in your daily life. Manipulation By definition, manipulation is a form of social influence that is designed to change either behaviors or perceptions of other people through methods that are deceptive in some way. Usually, the purpose is to allow the manipulator to get what he or she wants, even if it is at the expense of his or her target. Effectively, it is finding a way to coercively and secretly exploit someone else into doing what you want or need them to do. When you manipulate someone else, you have your own ulterior motive that you are pushing. You want to ensure that your desired result happens, regardless of whether it impacts you versus your child. For example, telling your child that he must tell the truth or you are going to die would be a form of emotional manipulation. You are putting excessive weight on the consequence that would never happen in order to coerce your child into telling you something. You may be trying to get him to tell the truth, but you are also doing so in a way that is emotionally harmful to the child. Sometimes, manipulation is a bit more difficult to spot—it can be finding ways to use insecurities against the victim without them being spotted. No matter what, however, what holds true is that manipulation is designed to override everyone’s inherent right to free will. This is not something to be proud of or to accept—if you are on the receiving end of manipulation, you should be trying to protect that free will as much as you can. If you are the manipulator, you may need to reconsider your motives and tactics. Keep in mind as you read through the rest of this chapter that this book does not condone the active and excessive use of manipulation. Controlling people is typically considered quite underhanded and cruel, and it should not be occurring on the regular, or at all if it can be avoided. It can be valuable to understand the art of manipulation in order to understand how the mind works, or how manipulators will attack, but ultimately, the use of true manipulation is not recommended. The Process of Manipulation People tend to believe that manipulation is effective for different reasons. They have different ideas about what makes manipulation effective. In particular, there are three criteria involving the manipulator that must be met in order to ensure that manipulation is successful. Ultimately, it is the manipulator that is primarily responsible for the manipulation and determining whether it will work, though there are certain personality traits that tend to be particularly vulnerable to the attempts to manipulate. The three criteria that must be met to ensure successful manipulation are: e The manipulator must hide the true intentions e The manipulator must know the victim’s most viable vulnerabilities e The manipulator must be ruthless enough to follow through Keep in mind that these three criteria being present is not a guarantee that the manipulation will always work. However, they must be present if it will work. Hiding true intentions If someone came up to you and said, “I am going to force you to buy me dinner,” you would be likely to outright refuse. People tend to be contrarian —they will lean toward doing the exact opposite of what someone else is asserting that they do simply because they want to have their free will. Because of this, manipulation only really works well when the true intentions are hidden. This way, the victim is unaware of the manipulation taking place and is more likely to fall for it. They will be unsuspecting and, therefore, more susceptible as opposed to if they were already on guard and looking for any attempts to force their hands. Understanding vulnerabilities Ultimately, the only way that you can possibly get to someone is if you know where their weak spots are. By taking advantage of the other party’s weak spots, you can effectively figure out exactly how to present what you want in order to ensure they give it to you. For example, if you know that you are dealing with a people pleaser, you may make it a point to mention that you have this really important need that you want to figure out how to meet and word it in just the right way that cues the other person to ask if they can help. This is an example of a vulnerability. Others can include: e They need to be given external approval e Fear of negative emotions e Unassertiveness e Struggling to know one’s true self e Struggling with self reliance e Feeling out of control e Being naive e Lacking self confidence e Being too conscientious Of course, there are other vulnerabilities as well, and you can begin to pinpoint more personal ones as well if you know what you are doing. Your job when manipulating others will be to figure out those vulnerabilities and use them. Ruthlessness Ultimately, manipulation is quite often harmful to at least one party that is being victimized. In most cases, the one being manipulated stands to lose something, and most people feel guilty at the idea of costing someone else something personal. For this reason, the successful manipulator must not care about the other person enough to be able to shirk off the guilt that would come along with hurting them. For many people, they are simply too empathetic to completely disregard everyone else. For others, however, it becomes effortless to simply disregard any guilt over feeling like they have used the other party. They move on with their lives after getting what they want without ever batting an eye. Manipulation Tactics Typically, manipulators exert some sort of control over their targets. They would have to in order to truly get their way. However, no two manipulators are the same. Some may favor positive reinforcement, while others prefer to punish. No matter the method, there is no denying that the manipulation can be exhausting, unhealthy, and sometimes completely dangerous. Within this section, we will identify the five distinct tactics that manipulators tend to use. Keep in mind that these tactics are separate from the techniques that will be discussed shortly. The tactics are sort of categories of different forms of manipulation—they are the most simplified form of classifying the techniques that you will be introduced to, and they use some sort of psychological tendency or process in order to control the other person. Positive reinforcement Rather than looking at positive as something good, think of positive as being provided or given something. When you are given positive reinforcement to encourage you to do something, you are introduced to some sort of motivator. You will get something as a direct result of your choice in action or in order to get you to do something. Action Positive Action performed atention/result reinforced For example, one form of positive reinforcement is being given praise or a reward for completing a task as you were expected to do. In particular, during manipulation, you may be offered praise if you do the right thing without being asked or encouraged to do it. Ultimately, it is designed to encourage. Other forms of positive reinforcement include: e Praise e Public recognition e Facial expressions e Approval e Love or affection e Gifts Negative reinforcement Negative reinforcement, on the other hand, involves using negative situations with the removal from that negative situation as the reward. When you are provided negative reinforcement, you are effectively being told that if you do something, a negative situation will be remedied in some way. This uses the negative situation and the desire to be rescued from that negativity as the motivation to push you toward a certain action. Negative Action Removal of Action situation performed negativity reinforced For example, imagine that you are in a bit of a bind—you may realize that you are $1000 short for your bills in three days and be panicking. A manipulator may say that they will give you that $1000 and therefore save you from the uncomfortable and terrifying potential of losing one’s home. Another example could involve telling a child that they will not have to do the dishes if they do whatever you want instead. Intermittent reinforcement Intermittent reinforcement refers to only sometimes providing positive reinforcement. Doing so causes doubt, fear, and a desire to keep trying to fish for that approval or positive reinforcement that is desired. The absence of whatever is being offered up intermittently can cause people to work harder to get it. Perhaps the easiest way to understand intermittent reinforcement is to look at gambling. In gambling, you are occasionally able to win, but most of the time, you lose. The occasional win and the knowledge that you have the chance to win are both enough for people to continually pour money into gambling, even though they are probably losing out on more money than they have ever won back. This form of reinforcement may be the most effective—it causes the individual to effectively become addicted to the chase toward success or fulfillment. Think about an abusive relationship for a moment—the victim will oftentimes become addicted to the intermittent reinforcement of the honeymoon period within the cycle of abuse, and that is enough to keep the individual stuck. Punishment When discussing punishment, you are thinking about the sudden inclusion of something negative as a response to a failure or refusal that is meant to be unpleasant in order to encourage the other person to act as you are hoping for. This causes the other party to give in, oftentimes, because the other party on the receiving end of the punishment is afraid or hurt, either physically or emotionally, and they want to avoid that same result in the first place. Think of fines when you get a ticket—the money you pay is, in part, administrative to take care of the cost of the police officer who issued the fine and the judge presiding over it. However, most of that fine is designed to punish you. You are losing out on a set amount of money because you have committed some sort of crime. Some examples of punishment include: e Yelling e Hurting (physically, i.e. spanking) e Playing the victim e The silent treatment e Nagging e Blackmail Traumatic one trial learning Finally, traumatic learning refers to the use of abuse or trauma in very specific instances in order to train the other party to feel like they must concede to avoid triggering such abuse in the future. Effectively, you are getting direct obedience through terrifying the other party into obedience in the first place. This is among some of the more harmful types of manipulation that people receive. Undesired action performed Manipulator severely punishes Action discouraged For example, you may find that you have returned home for the family for the holidays, and your partner drove over just a bit later—no big deal, sometimes families drive separately. However, your partner is furious that you went rather than staying home where you would have been present with him. He then screams at you about how you are never home or present for him and goes onto a rampage. The message that he is trying to send is that upsetting him is never worth it. Some forms of this include: e Abuse of any kind e Establishing dominance e Allowing emotions to blow out of control Manipulation Techniques Manipulation comes in several forms beyond those five different tactics. Some people may gaslight while others love bomb and devalue. Others still may choose to delve into mind control. There are several different manipulation techniques that can all be used in various situations, meaning that you always have plenty of options. What may work in one situation is not necessarily guaranteed to work in another, and most of the time, manipulators will have several different techniques in their back pocket to draw from as needed. Understanding each of these different forms of manipulation means that you can be prepared. When you are prepared, you become less susceptible to that form of manipulation. You will effectively be able to protect yourself because you know what the patterns are and can recognize them as they occur, allowing you to figure out giving in. This section will provide an explanation of the eight common methods that are used. Love bombing and devaluing This form of manipulation is particularly common in relationships with narcissists. The manipulator will shower the other person with love and gifts to essentially addict the individual to them. Then, when the manipulator wants something that is not being given, that love will suddenly be revoked, often with intentionally hurting or knocking the individual down a few pegs. They may stop responding or tell the victim that they no longer care about the other person. The idea is to make the victim desire that love bombing stage again to get them to work extra hard to attain it. It usually occurs in a cycle. Showering victim with love Victim tries to Love is slowly win back withheld favor more Victirn suddenly rejected This is the quintessential form of intermittent reinforcement. Gaslighting In gaslighting, the manipulator seeks to make the other party feel entirely incompetent and doubtful of whether or not they can truly accurately identify what is going on around them. The whole point is to make them feel unstable, and like their perceptions of reality, are incorrect. For example, they may tell the victim that the victim’s perception never happened, or that the victim is making things out to be far worse than they actually were. The gaslighter will deny and reject thoughts and opinions so convincingly that the victim will trust the gaslighter, and over time, the gaslighter will retain complete control. The silent treatment This is a common form of punishment in abusive situations. During the silent treatment, the person who is being ignored will be entirely erased— the individual will not acknowledge their presence or that they have said or done anything. If the one being ignored says something, the one ignoring will stare right past them. The entire purpose of this is to make the other person feel the displeasure that the manipulator is feeling. It can also lead to the individual being manipulated to be so desperate to get back to the way things used to be that they will comply with any requests provided. Guilt tripping The guilt trip tactic is designed to make the person being manipulated feel guilty simply because guilt is a motivating emotion, and the feeling of guilt is one that drives people to do whatever they can to alleviate it. If you are able to guilt trip someone, you effectively make them feel like the only way they can escape that guilt is through doing whatever you have asked them to do. For example, your sibling may tell you that they cannot afford to keep their home if you do not lend them the money and that if you refuse, it will be on you if their children are removed or if your sibling loses custody. Playing the victim Oftentimes, the manipulator will spin things around, so they reflect that the manipulator is actually the victim of the circumstances rather than the aggressor of the situation. For example, if a manipulator gets into an argument with someone else, they may tell everyone else that they were the victim in some way, shape, or form in order to gain sympathy. They will twist the truth in order to make sure that they are believed to not be responsible for whatever has happened. Scapegoating In scapegoating, someone else is made to take the fall for a situation. They may push all of their faults onto the scapegoat, particularly when a child is involved, but they may also simply refuse to give the same consideration to the one being scapegoated. This is another form of intermittent reinforcement. Mind control Another common method of manipulation is through mind control. When you are controlling the mind of someone else, you are effectively swaying them to do something that they do not want to do, even if it is not necessarily what they would want to do. This is usually a method that takes plenty of time, however, as the one doing the controlling has to first get into a trusted position with the person, then slowly work up to the situation and then take it when the time is right. Covert intimidation This refers to the sort of intimidation where you are not quite sure why you are feeling scared, but you cannot help it. You simply feel like something is going to go wrong or that there is some sort of problem that you will face if you do not make it a point to first do what was expected of you. In covert intimidation, you cannot quite put your finger on it, but you know that something is making you uneasy. Chapter 2: When and Why to use Manipulation Now, are you curious why people would choose to use this sort of manipulation? Why does anyone need that level of control over someone else’s actions or feelings? Who would use these forms of manipulation? Who actually is ruthless enough to follow through without guilt or regret? All of those are fantastic questions, and this chapter seeks to answer as many of those questions as possible. When these questions are answered, your portrait of the manipulator will become all the clearer. Who Manipulates? Manipulators come in several forms. Some are younger and simply have not learned how to interact with the world. Others still just happen to be manipulative by nature—they are intentionally using their abilities to get what they want with no regard for how it hurts other people. Ultimately, however, the manipulators tend to have several traits in common. This section will address several traits and tendencies that can help you identify a manipulator in the process of manipulating. They are always the victim It does not matter what has happened—the manipulator will always be the victim or not at fault in some way. The manipulator could pull out a gun and shoot you and would rationalize that he had no choice and insist that he was the victim as he holds the smoking gun in his hand. This is a common trait of manipulators as it makes them deserving of sympathy, which gives them the upper hand in many different situations. They will try to figure out how to get all of your friends and family on their side and will blame everything on you. The worst part is that since they are so skillful at doing exactly this, they can often convince other people to fall for it. They regularly distort the truth The manipulator will always twist reality. Skilled at weaving webs of lies, the manipulator will always have a way to rewrite history, change a situation, or otherwise make it, so their narrative is the correct one. One such example is playing the victim. Other times, they may simply make up lies because the lies suit them, such as saying that they are struggling to get to work because there was a car accident and that they will be there soon, or claiming that they cannot go outside to get to their car because a bear is sitting next to it. Some lies may seem incredibly unconvincing, but they will vehemently insist that he is telling the truth. They are passive aggressive Manipulators tend to be passive aggressive. A part of this is to make sure that you know your place around the manipulator—they use it to assert dominance and covertly exert their own influence and desire over you. For example, they will intentionally use passive aggression to make you feel bad, and then be satisfied that they held power necessary to make you feel bad in the first place. They will pressure you The manipulator is convinced that he is always right no matter what, and with that in mind, he will not hesitate to pressure you in order to get whatever he wants from you at any given moment. He knows that his way is the right way, and he will force the point until you agree. They will not work to solve a problem If you find that there is a problem with the manipulator, good luck—they will not work to come to some sort of solution. Instead, they will continue on as if nothing is wrong, or at the very least, that nothing is wrong with them. They could not care more about your own problems, so long as they are not the manipulator’s problems. They will always keep the advantage The manipulator has an uncanny way to always remain in control in nearly any situation. They will oftentimes find a way to ensure that they can find a way to stay in charge. They will always pick the restaurant that you go to, or they will always invite you out of your comfort zone and into theirs, all done intentionally to maintain power and control over the situation. When they do this, they effectively guarantee that they are able to stay in charge long enough to keep you off balance and make sure that they always have the upper hand. They will always have excuses When they do happen to make a mistake, manipulators typically will have some sort of excuse. There was a car accident on the way over, or they just got fired for no reason at all. It does not matter what the problem is; there will be some sort of excuse that will arise to take the blame away from the manipulator and push it onto someone else. They will make you feel unconfident Something about the manipulator will always leave you feeling incompetent and unable to do anything right. This means that you will constantly be feeling like you are the problem rather than seeing that the whole problem may have been resting firmly with the manipulator all along. Why Manipulate? Manipulators have all sorts of reasons to manipulate others, with some simply having no reason at all. When you begin to understand the motivation behind these drives, you may be more inclined to understand those techniques that the manipulators everywhere tend to use. This means then that you will be able to figure out how to fight back. You can defend yourself and others based on the knowledge that you have. Knowing why people manipulate others can be a critical skill to develop if you want to be successful in the world around you. They want to advance in life When you feel like you need to advance somehow, whether due to needing the money in order to get what you wanted or needed, manipulation is one way to get it. When you manipulate someone, you are usually using them as a sort of stepping stone for yourself in order to ensure that you can, in fact, withstand future struggles while also progressing the agenda that you have. Typically, this is the most selfish of the reasons on this list—these manipulators do so simply because they can. They need power and superiority Similar to the last reason for manipulation, oftentimes, manipulators need to feel like they are in power. They simply are only secure in themselves so long as they are in a position of power over other people. If they feel like their superiority will be questioned in any way, shape, or form, they will feel insecure. They will feel like the only way they can make themselves feel comfortable is if they exert and enforce their own superiority, which they give themselves through making a point to manipulate those around them. They need control When people are particularly controlling, they may find that manipulation is one of the easiest ways to get the results desired. When you are able to manipulate someone else into doing what they need to do, you are able to ensure that you maintain control in nearly any situation. You may have to find a way to covertly encourage the other person to do what you want, but as soon as you manage to do that, you can effectively maintain control, even if the other person does not realize that you are in control of the situation at hand. The need to be in control can be particularly motivating for people when it comes to deciding to manipulate. They need to manipulate to better their own self esteem Some people, such as narcissists, tend to feel like they are only comfortable with themselves when other people are lavishing them with attention or admiration. These people tend to result in manipulation to get that attention, especially if they are not particularly outstanding or deserving of attention in the first place. In manipulating other people into giving them the craved attention, they are able to feel better about themselves. They are bored Some people simply enjoy watching the world burn and will make it a point to manipulate other people simply to get entertainment. They treat it like a game or a challenge, intentionally testing boundaries to see how far they can get with no real reason or motivation beyond being bored to guide them. These may be some of the more dangerous manipulators as they have no real goal in mind—they simply want to wreak havoc and spend some time messing with other people despite not getting anything other than their own Satisfaction in return. They have a hidden agenda More often than not, the manipulator has some sort of reason to manipulate those around him or her. This is typically hidden from the target but can be figured out with enough time and information. Think about how some people will intentionally seek out vulnerable people with ulterior motives. They may marry in order to get their hands on money, or intentionally volunteer as a caregiver for an elderly family member in order to steal money from them. No matter what the hidden agenda is, the manipulator has good cause to try to keep it hidden. They do not properly identify with the emotions of others Sometimes, the manipulation is unintentional and a side effect of simply being unable to identify with other people. Effectively, they lack empathy, and that lack of empathy is enough to make it so they cannot easily identify when they have done something that is manipulative, nor do they automatically recognize when what they have done is problematic. These are people who simply do not understand social norms for some reason or another. They may have a personality or other mental health disorder. When Manipulation Occurs No one wants to be on the receiving end of manipulation, and yet it seems to be all around us. The world is literally surrounded by different people and their attempts to manipulate. You can see it on television and in the media. You can see it in religion and politics. It happens in all kinds of relationships when they become unhealthy. There is no real way to truly avoid manipulation, and that in and of itself can be incredibly disheartening. However, because manipulation is everywhere, it becomes prudent to understand what it looks like in a wide variety of situations and cases. You want to be able to notice when it is happening and figure out how best to fight back from it to ensure that you actually are able to protect yourself. When you are able to protect yourself from manipulation, you can guarantee that you, at the very least, are not regularly being used by other people simply because you refuse to allow yourself to be Within this section, we will take a look at manipulation in several different relationships and contexts for a brief overview of what to expect and why it happens. In relationships This is particularly referring to romantic relationships. Romantic relationships seem to attract manipulation frequently, especially if one member of the couple happens to be on the less confrontational side and is afraid of ever standing up for him or herself. When this happens, you may find that you have run into quite the conundrum—you need to figure out how best to leave a romantic relationship rife with manipulation, which can be difficult if the manipulator has done his job right. In particular, when you are in a relationship and at risk for manipulation, you will realize that the other party is likely to completely steamroll over the relationship. The other party may try to get you to move quicker than you are usually comfortable with, insisting that you advance your relationship to the next level in a whirlwind romance. If the person seems too good to be true in a situation like that, you can usually assume that it was full of manipulation in the first place and should be avoided if at all possible. In friendships Manipulative friends may try to get on your good side as quickly as possible, but they will soon fall into the habit of always needing you but never being available when you need them. At first, you will assume it is a coincidence, but over time, you will realize that it is actually a pattern, leaving you stuck to decide whether you would like to leave the friendship altogether or if you would prefer to instead put up with the manipulator’s lack of support and enjoy what you can. In churches Churches commonly also manipulate people, attempting to force them into situations and actions that they may not necessarily want. In particular, you will commonly see threats of damnation and punishment if they do not live by a very specific life, and that is a perfect example of manipulation. They use their authority to sort of force your hand and make you feel like you have no choice but to comply. This is what they count on—they assume that you will continue to donate, to serve, and to attend because they threaten you if you do not. While many people may not see it as a threat, being told that you may be excommunicated or that you will be damned for eternity are two ways to sort of scare someone into behaving a certain way. In politics Politicians frequently attempt to manipulate each other during debates and will attempt to manipulate the people during speeches. You can see it in the way they hold themselves and how they interact with each other that they are trained and scripted on what to do, and even the way that they stand has been scripted to avoid any of the typical discomfort signs, such as crossing arms. Instead, to be seen as more powerful, they may fiddle with a watch or a piece of jewelry to try to hide their gut reaction to show signs of distress. In cults Cults commonly use brainwashing techniques in which they may tear down entire personalities to install their own, more obedient ones in other people. They may welcome people with open arms, making them feel like they are welcome and will be happy, but over time, the manipulation and brainwashing will increase. Eventually, people are left as shells of themselves, forced to obey and do whatever they have been told if they want to avoid punishment. You can see these in extreme cults in particular, and cults can be so effective that leaders can literally command their followers to kill themselves or others, and they will do so, such as in the Jamestown cult, in which everyone drank flavored drink laced with poison as a mass suicide. In sales positions Sometimes, people in sales positions will have to get crafty with how they choose to present themselves in order to guarantee that they can, in fact, actually close a sale. They may choose to use certain appeals to authority or emotion in an attempt to convince you, or they may try to scare you into submission in other instances. No matter the situation, however, it is common to see salespeople try all sorts of influential attempts to get you to buy something. Even something as simple as asking you a few yes questions can be a form of manipulation taken from neuro linguistic programming, depending on if the other party is prepared with the techniques. In particular, much of the influence that you will see in sales settings tend to be persuasion or NLP. In court In court, when lawyers are often battling it out to figure out the truth, you may see manipulation. Especially if the lawyers happen to be particularly eager to prove their own positions, you may run into issues in which both parties start flinging manipulative attempts at each other. They may word their questions in a loaded manner to try to get the other party to fall for it. They may try to frame the other party or pressure them into confessing. Ultimately, even though the courtroom is supposed to be particularly unbiased, you can frequently see manipulative attempts to control each other play out. In negotiations Negotiations attempts are another area in which you may see attempts to manipulate or influence each other. Both parties have a certain desire, and they are likely to attempt to get their way in some degree. Of course, negotiations also come along with compromise, so some concessions will have to be made, but the individual responsible for those concessions may change depending on the results of the negotiation. Chapter 3: The Power of Persuasion Have you ever been trying to figure out what to do for dinner one night only to have your partner or child come up to you with a complete argument on why you should go to your favorite sushi restaurant for dinner? Perhaps the argument is all nicely laid out for you. Your child points out that you would not have to cook or clean, which means that you have more time to spend with your family, something that is in desperately short supply these days. Your child points out that everyone loves sushi, so you cannot go wrong going to the restaurant and that the whole family will find something to eat. Lastly, your child tells you that he knows that you really want to get some sushi because you always want to get some sushi. You may realize that your child is right—all of that is true, and you agree to go. In this instance, you have just been persuaded to go out to dinner by your child. Now, the argument and attempt to persuade may have been rather simplified, but it still counts as a form of influence. You were not thinking about going out to dinner until your child pointed out all of the reasons that you should. This means, then, that your child influenced your choice. Of course, most of the time, persuasion attempts tend to be a bit less obvious. They may be as simple as wording things in a way that is conducive to you making a specific decision. They may be pointing out that the other party knows best because the other party happens to be an expert on whatever is being sold. No matter the form, however, what persuasion does that manipulation does not is that it puts the question out in the open for everyone to see. Slightly more acceptable than its sister form of influence, persuasion focuses more on free will than covertly attempting to convince someone to give in and be controlled. In particular, you may find that you actually are okay with persuasion simply because it is more out in the open than the covert attempt to manipulate. They are quite similar, however, and within this chapter, you will be introduced to what persuasion is. What is Persuasion? Persuasion, like manipulation, is a form of social influence. It is designed to change the thoughts, feelings, or behaviors of someone else for reasons that are listed or dictated for the other person in the bid to get the other person to change. This means that the other person is well aware of the attempt early on. Just as your child pointed out that you would love to go to sushi for dinner, any other form of persuasion is going to be telling you what you should be wanting or doing. It will encourage you to do something in particular in an attempt to persuade you, but you are still always welcome to turn it down and move on with your initial choice. Typically, persuasion is incredibly powerful. You are creating an argument of some sort for someone else and attempting to follow through with that argument. You want other people to see that your argument is valid and that you have the right idea. You want to figure out how to do just that without there being a clear and easy way to get out of it. All this means that you need to figure out what will motivate your target and then figure out how to motivate them. This usually happens in several different ways, such as in the principles of persuasion or with the understanding and usage of rhetoric. What is true, however, is that you should end up with someone who has at least some sort of idea about what they want by the end of the attempt. They will either agree with you, or they will disagree and move on, and it will be up to you to figure out which. Persuasion vs. Manipulation At face value, the two seem to be intricately linked—they are both attempts to convince or cause someone to do something else. However, you likely persuade someone nearly every single day, and yet you may make it a point to never manipulate others. You are able to toe the line because the two are entirely different from each other. In particular, however, you must look at the differing definitions of the two attempts to influence. In manipulation, you are attempting to change via unfair means for one’s own selfish purposes. For persuasion, however, you are looking to cause someone to do something. This means that primarily, manipulation is unfair or secretive by default—it seeks to use and abuse people in order to satisfy the manipulator and whatever it is that the manipulator wants. Persuasion, on the other hand, is simply a way that people interact with those around them. You are attempting to persuade someone to help you because you feel like they may be a valuable asset, and you think that they will get something out of it, too. You are completely upfront about everything when you attempt to persuade someone, however when you manipulate, you are not. For example, consider that you really need a ride to work tomorrow for some reason. You go up to your neighbor and say, “Hey, you know, I noticed that your yard could use some TLC—would you like me to help you with that today? I’m free all day!” The neighbor agrees, and the two of you happily chat while taking care of yard work. The neighbor, upon finishing everything up, asks if you need any help yourself, offering to reciprocate. You reply that actually, you need a ride to work, and you would greatly appreciate it. On the other hand, if you had wanted to manipulate the neighbor into a ride, you may have gone out in the morning like usual and desperately tried to start your car while groaning loudly and slamming on the steering wheel before looking at your watch in exasperation. In this case, you are not interacting with the other person directly at all—you are making it clear that you are unhappy, but you are not speaking to your neighbor. Your neighbor happens to see your plight and offers to help you, getting your ride without you ever having to ask for help. That is manipulation. You intentionally did something with your own self interest in mind. You did not help your neighbor, and simply took advantage of his kindness when he offered to give you a ride without any offer for reciprocity. As you can see, manipulation versus persuasion can be a bit complex to figure out if you do not know what you are looking at, but it is important. Effectively, when you are manipulating someone else, you are attempting to make them do something for you without you having to overtly ask for it in any way. Using Persuasion Between the two, persuasion is generally deemed to be socially acceptable and something that will not be problematic for you if you were to be on the receiving end of it. You may not feel like persuasion is particularly threatening in the way that manipulation typically is considered simply because when someone attempts to persuade you, they are usually honest with you. They will tell you exactly what they want or need and they will usually offer up reasons for why you should help them, which may sometimes be a negotiation of services or otherwise simply appealing got logic or something else to prove that you helping would literally be no inconvenience to you, but would be a lifesaver to them. When you are planning to use persuasion against someone else, you are likely to need some sort of plan. Generally speaking, you will need to know exactly what you want and how you need to get to that result. If you want to get a job, for example, you may realize that the steps to get a job will require you to be applying for jobs and working on your resume as much as possible. You may see that there is little room for error and that you will need to actively attempt to find that job. When you make your plan, you can start to figure out who you will ask for help. Do you know anyone with some connections? Do you have a friend that works somewhere with job openings? Do you have any skills that can get you that job that you really need or want? If you can answer yes to any of that, you can figure out who you want to target for your persuasion. After all, there always has to be someone on the receiving end when you attempt to persuade someone. Upon identifying who you will persuade, you must figure out how you wish to persuade them. Now, this will be a bit trickier to figure out—there are dozens of ways that you could go about trying to persuade someone, and ultimately, you will need to choose the one that works best for you. When you can identify exactly how you wish to be persuading someone else, you can begin to put together the best possible toolset to do so. Now, we will not get into the tools for persuasion until the next chapter, so hold tight on that particular concept. However, recognize that there are several persuasive techniques that can be used, so long as you make it a point to use them effectively. With the plan in mind and the tools in mind, and recognizing that you are not only persuading to get help, you need to figure out what you are willing to offer in return. Why should the other person help you? Will you do something in return? Will it benefit them in any way? Remember, manipulation is the one that is self serving. When you are persuading someone, everyone should see at least some sort of benefits to helping or agreeing to whatever you are attempting to persuade them of. Finally, with the who, what, how, and why figured out, you can now attempt to use your technique. Now is the time to go up and talk to whomever you have identified as the individual that you are asking for help. Remember, you should probably try asking them if you can help them before slamming onto the theme of everything that you are looking for from them. This means that you can make it a point to ask and persuade. You should point out all of the reasons that helping would be good for the other person, as well as what you will do in return. Persuasion is a give and take, after all, and you need to be clear to the other person that you absolutely intend to give as well as take to ensure that they do not feel pressured or stuck in the process. When you do this, you assure them that you are not simply using them, especially once you follow through with helping them. Persuasion in the World At this point, you should have a generally solid idea that persuasion is something that can involve give and take—that either the giver or both people should benefit. As a general rule, the taker should never be the only one benefitting from persuasion. You can see this happen in several contexts. You may see people shopping for a house and notice that persuasion happens during the sales. You may see that persuasion happens in regular interactions with your romantic partner simply as a side effect to the fact that you two regularly interact with each other and will often have something or another that you really want or need. You can see it in parenting, and in negotiations as well. Leaders are also masters at persuasion—especially if they are effective leaders, and you will often see that the best leaders are well loved and incredibly persuasive. They know how to wield their tools so well that those around them are always willing to help. This section will take the time to go over several contexts in which you may run into an attempt at persuasion throughout your life. It is incredibly common to see persuasion pop up regularly because it is so regularly used in terms of interactions. If you want someone to do something, the best way to get them to do it is by asking them to do it. If you can do that, you are well on your way to persuading them. In sales When you are buying something, such as a car, you may run into someone who is interested in attempting to sell you something that you were not necessarily interested in at first. In order to be an attempt at persuasion, the newly presented car should do something for you—it should be useful to you in some way, shape, or form, and it will be on you to determine if the use of that new car is enough to encourage you to move forward with getting the new car or if you want to stick with whatever your original choice was. Perhaps you went in for a small sedan because you do not like to drive anything much large. However, you have two young children, and you find that you are always frustrated that you do not have enough room for car seats, a stroller, a diaper bag, and any shopping you may do during the day. This means that your car, despite being one that you are comfortable driving, is not one that you are necessarily going to be comfortable in using on a regular basis. The salesperson sees that you need some more space and recommends some compact SUVs to you as well. They are just big enough that they will actually accommodate the rest of your belongings without causing you to struggle to fit some groceries when you run to the store during the day as well. Now, to be fair, the SUV is a bit more expensive, and you know this. The salesperson knows this too, and you can presume that the salesperson is going to get a slightly larger commission on the SUV as opposed to the sedan. However, after mulling it over, you realize that the salesperson was right— you need the space. You need room for your children, their necessities, and anything that you may get when you are out, and your stroller barely fits in the trunk as it is without anything extra. You then decide to go with the SUV. Now, what makes this persuasion and not manipulation is the attempt to make sure that you know what you are doing and that the salesperson is genuinely trying to help you. Now, if the salesperson were simply trying to convince you to get the largest car on the market with the most expensive monthly payment, that would have been more along the lines of manipulation, but considering that your salesperson showed you some reasonable options and did not push the point, it was considered to be persuasive instead. In relationships You can see this sort of give and take play out in relationships, too—for example, imagine that you and your partner are ready to take the next step and move in together. However, neither of you really wants to let go of your apartment. Ultimately, the best way to get one of the two of you out of their home and into the other’s home is through persuasion—you will both have to come up with the reasons to stay in your own respective apartments while the other party moves. Because neither of you are attempting to underhandedly manipulate your way into staying in your own home and you are both willing to calmly consider what is going on and what the reasons for staying or going would be in order to rationally decide the best course of action, this is considered an attempt of persuasion. In parenting In parenting, the best thing that you can do is learn t0 talk to your child, so they understand you clearly and effectively. This means that you need to figure out how best to communicate with your own child, and that could very well be different than what you would use for someone else that you know or with someone else’s kid. If you can effectively learn to communicate with your child, you can then use persuasion on a regular basis. When you are raising a child, what you are doing is trying to figure out how best to help them become responsible, mature adults that are productive and capable of interacting with those around them. This means that they need to develop skills such as how to persuade someone or how best to communicate when they need something. This means that you should teach by example—you should talk to your child using the same persuasive patterns that you would use for a friend or family member. For example, if they really want a cookie and ask nicely for one, you could very politely say, “I am so proud of you for using your manners! But you know, dinner is about to be finished, and you need to make sure that you Save room to eat your dinner. How about we have it tomorrow after lunch because you don’t need sugar after dinner.” This involved you negotiating a new time for eating the cookie and your child agreeing. Now, of course, you could have simply said, “No cookie; it’s too late,” and had that be the end of discussion, but that would not have been doing your child any favors. Instead, you are making it clear that good communication skills are critical if they want to be successful at all. You are helping them become the best possible adults that they can be because you are teaching them skills such as persuasion early on. In negotiation Negotiation is something that only certain people will deal with on a regular basis, but nearly everyone will face it at one point or another. If you need to negotiate with someone, persuasion is the perfect way to begin attempting to get someone to see your own side. Effectively, you can lay out your argument for having things done your way, offering up your own concessions, and then seeing what happens next. You want your negotiation partner to feel willing to accept the deal that you have put out without feeling like they are being taken advantage of because taking advantage is not one of the main purposes of persuasion—being fair and forthcoming is. At work Finally, at work, you are likely to need persuasion at some point in time. Do you need a day off for a trip? You will have to persuade your boss that you need it. Do you want a raise? Why do you deserve it? How will your own productivity change if you get that raise in order to warrant it when you ask? What can you possibly do to make that raise worthwhile? Beyond just negotiations with employers, however, you also need to be prepared to negotiate with clients or business partners, and you will need persuasion to make you effective at those as well. Ultimately, nearly any time you need to ask someone to do something, you are effectively trying to persuade them to do something. This is exactly why persuasion is so incredibly important to have a solid grasp upon. Chapter 4: Mind Control Techniques with Persuasion Now, you have seen just how critical persuasion can be in several different contexts. At this point, it is time to start seeing the techniques that you can use to persuade other people. Remember, persuasion is all about being clear about what you are asking for. However, on the other hand, it is also about convincing people to do what you want. You need to be able to walk along that fine line without falling on either side if you want to be effective. This chapter will introduce you to both the principles of persuasion and the rhetoric of persuasion. You will be guided through each and every step of the persuasion and provided with the reasoning that you should make it a point to truly develop these skills. Each has its own important uses if you are willing to put in the effort to learn them. Principles of Persuasion First, we will discuss the principles of persuasion. These are six different persuasive tools that you can use in order to convince those around you to behave in certain ways. They can be used on their own or in tandem with others on this list. However, what is important is that you remember that these tools are useful, and you practice them whenever you get the chance. Authorit Social proof Authority The first of the principles of persuasion is authority. When you seek to appeal to authority, you are simply trying to make yourself into some sort of authority figure. This is for a very specific reason. Stop and consider for a moment—would you rather take medical advice from a random person walking down the road or from a doctor wearing a lab coat and a badge? Which would seem more convincing to you? If both of them held out a pill in their hand and urged you to take it, would you? Many people would be willing to be treated by the doctor in the coat and with a badge. They are deemed to be an authority on medicine just because they happen to be wearing a lab coat and have their credentials printed out on their badge. The other person, however, is some random nobody, and even if they were to say that they are a doctor, you would have no way of knowing for sure, nor would you be able to verify what was being offered to you to take. Ultimately, this is exactly the kind of divide you would see ordinarily— when there is an appeal made to authority, the one who is knowledgeable wins out. The one deemed to be more of an authority due to credentials or experience wins out in the end. This means that when you want to appeal to authority, what you need to do is make sure that you find a way to make it clear that you are, in fact, an authority on the subject. If you are the car salesperson, maybe have letters and pictures from your happy clients that have bought cars from you and left fully satisfied after your help. Maybe you should pay attention to the fact that when people walk in, the first thing you want them to see is that you are qualified at your job. You may set up so they can see your diploma or awards, or you will make sure that they hear about it in the first few minutes of the meeting. Commitment and consistency The next principle of persuasion is known as commitment and consistency. When you are dealing with commitment and consistency, you are effectively playing on the fact that people tend to like what is familiar and expected. This means that people will always try to continuously follow through on a commitment that they have made, and the more often that they make that particular commitment, the more likely they are to continue to make that commitment with it eventually just becoming standard. For example, say you asked your neighbor, who happens to be your coworker, for a ride to work. It is literally no inconvenience because you both travel both ways at the same time. After several drives in which your coworker takes you to work, it eventually becomes expected, and you no longer have to ask—you are simply waiting by your neighbor’s car before and after work each day to catch that ride. Effectively, the first time they agreed to take you, they locked themselves into a chain of repeatedly being asked by you for rides and agreeing to do so on a regular basis. People love to be consistent—it is valuable to be consistent, and because of that, people will usually continue to follow through, even if they do not like it and do not want to continue. You can trick people into doing things for you with this same process as well. If you want something, such as maybe wanting your coworker to cover a shift for you, you may start by asking a simple yes question, such as asking if they have had a nice week so far. Your neighbor says yes, and then you ask if they will trade shifts with you so you can make sure that you are able to go to a concert that you have been looking forward to. Thanks to having already begun to say yes to other things, your coworker is going to be in a state of mind in which he or she is already saying yes, so they may as well continue. After agreeing to a few smaller things as well, you may run into someone who is willing to accommodate more difficult or larger requests in the name of consistency. Liking This is perhaps one of the most straightforward of the principles of persuasion—all you need to remember is that the more you like someone or something, the more likely you are to feel like whatever you liked is valuable, and the more likely you are to be convinced in its favor. For example, you are more likely to do a favor for someone that you really like than someone that you do not like at all. Luckily, there are several ways that you can make it a point to become likable to someone else. You can, for example, mirror someone until they like you. This means that you would be copying their behaviors as covertly as you could possibly manage, which may not be particularly secretively if you do not know what you are doing. Upon setting everything up and mirroring the other person to the point that they mirror you back, you should be good to continue. However, if you are unsure how to proceed with mirroring or you simply do not want to deal with it, there are other techniques you can use as well, such as choosing to intentionally make someone like you. This is not nearly as difficult as it sounds. Start by making some sort of connection between yourself and the other party—perhaps you make it a point to comment that you can relate to the other person when they arrive with their child to an appointment. You tell them that you have a child about the same age and that going back to work at that age is just so difficult. With the connection made, you will want to make eye contact and continue to talk. You may offer the other party some praise or a compliment, meant to make them feel like you genuinely care about what they are saying or what they think. The catch here is that the compliment that you make has to be genuine, and you must mean it. Finally, if you want to be likable, you must make it clear that the two of you are on the same side. Perhaps you point out that you will both be working together toward getting the other person a car. Maybe you convince them that you will both try to solve their problem, no matter what it is, with them. This camaraderie set up then makes it less likely for the partners to worry about them. Create a sense of teamwork Make a Offer a Connection compliment Reciprocity The next principle of persuasion is reciprocity. When you are appealing to reciprocity, effectively, you are working with the attitude that you will help anyone that helps you first. You make it clear that you are happy to help them if you think that they will respond in kind. This is not nearly as entitled as it may seem upfront. Think about how, when a friend buys you a gift, you feel like you must reciprocate? This is intentional with human development—it is done, so you feel the urge to reciprocate when someone else is offering you something. This means that when someone else has helped you, you will be more inclined to help them when they need help. You effectively safeguard with your own altruistic behaviors to make sure that both you and the other party are able to receive in your times of need. If you want to take advantage of this, for example, you may start by reaching out to someone that you need help from. Maybe you want your neighbor to take care of your dog while you go out of town overnight. You then offer to do something for your neighbor. Perhaps you clean up his yard before asking him if he can take care of your dog for the day. You let him know that all he will have to do is let your dog out a couple of times, and things will be fine. After having been helped by you, he feels obligated to follow through and help you out as well. He agrees to take care of your dog during your trip, and that is one less thing for you to worry about over the next several days. Scarcity Scarcity refers to supply and demand. Effectively, the more regular or readily available something or someone is, the less important it is. You can often see this with material items—limited edition items tend to be far more in demand than the same item in a standard color. For example, if you really want that newest game console, but you want the one specific to your favorite game series, you are likely going to have to find it on a used sale site and hope that you can find it at a regular price. Otherwise, you will have no choice but to simply trudge on ahead without that particular console. This is because the regular console is common. It is easy to attain and therefore is not particularly important to you, nor is it deemed as valuable as the regular one to you. Now, you may be wondering how supply and demand can relate to persuading someone to do something. The answer is that you need to make sure that you are able to convince them that you are in demand. Perhaps you find that your partner seems to take you for granted. If you have a serious talk with your partner about how you do not feel loved or respected, and during that talk, you mention that you would rather be anywhere but there because it is so exhausting to live completely unwanted. This should cue to your partner that you will not always be available—you are only available as long as you wish to make yourself available, and that immediately ups your value. You can do this with other people, too. Reject the first attempt to schedule something with you and say that the date does not work for you. When you get to a date just a bit later, you can convince the other party that you are worth the money that will be put into you. You want people to feel like they got lucky to get you. After all, you are one of a kind—treat yourself like it. Social proof Finally, social proof refers to the tendency of people to fall for peer pressure. This is effectively just a fancy word for peer pressure and involves you actively making a point to choose to defer to what other people are doing. If you do not know what you should be doing, you effectively decide to defer to what you see around you. If you see that your peers are dancing in a circle, but you do not know why they are dancing in a circle, you are likely going to just join in without understanding why, and that is okay. You do it anyway and never find out why. When you want to use this form of persuasion effectively, you will just want to set up a control area. Do you remember why so many manipulators liked the home court advantage? It is so they are able to manipulate their surroundings. You can do this, too. For example, if you want someone to do something for you, make sure that you ask them around other people that are actively doing whatever it was that you asked them to do in the first place. For example, if you want to go around and collect signatures and donations for a cause, you would want to be sure that those around you are actively seeing that you are getting what you want. When they see that other people are signing and donating, they are more likely to do so, especially if they recognize names, or they feel like they need to keep up with their peers. Effectively, then, this works well to keep people in line just by maintaining the environment around them. Rhetoric Another series of techniques that can help you become more persuasive is the art of rhetoric. Rhetoric is the art to speak or write persuasively in an attempt to get other people to see things your way. Dating way back to the time of Aristotle, the ancient Greek philosopher, if you are able to form your arguments with rhetoric, you can make sure that you are addressing other people in a way that is compelling and difficult to reject or ignore. In particular, rhetoric involves three distinct methods of persuasion—these are three techniques that are commonly used in order to make sure that the other person is likely to go along with your suggestion. These are commonly referred to by their Greek names of Ethos, Pathos, and Logos. Ethos Appeal to Appealto Appeal to character emotion logic Builds Builds Builds reasons credibility for emotions for for the speaker the listener compliance Ethos Ethos is an appeal to character. It focuses on making sure that the one presenting all of the information for the listener is viewed as credible. If the speaker is not credible, no one is going to believe in what he or she has to say, which means that his or her attempts and techniques will be particularly worthless. After all, you cannot clearly convince someone else to do something if they do not trust you. This is essentially quite similar to the appeal to authority in the principles of persuasion. Ethos primarily can be seen in advertising—when you are trying to sell something, you want to make sure you have someone credible be the one advocating for your product, and staying true to that, you often find that celebrities commonly are called in to promote the brands. Of course, those people are being paid for their time and endorsements, but the effect is undeniable. For example, imagine a local sports personality making it clear that he always drinks one particular brand of soda without fail. The next time that you are in the mood for soda, if you happen to be a fan of that particular person, you may find that you are far more likely to pick up that same brand of soda simply because your unconscious mind wants to emulate someone that you are fond of. This works precisely because people admire others, and when they do admire someone else, they want to emulate them. People naturally want to be like the people they look up to or admire in any way, and because of that, they will be more likely to make decisions based on those admired individuals. Pathos The next form of rhetoric that is commonly used is pathos—this is an appeal to emotions. This is effectively coming up with a way to establish an emotion in your listeners in hopes of getting them to act in a way that you want to see. You may make someone feel sad or guilty in order to get them to donate. You may try to make someone angry in order to make them act. You may try to make someone feel happy to encourage them to like whatever you are promoting. Ultimately, emotions are so powerful precisely because they are meant to be motivating. You are going to naturally feel inclined to act according to your emotions simply because that is why they are there. Your emotions are effectively your unconscious mind’s way of interacting with your body, creating emotional impulses that are meant to keep you alive. You may feel fear when you are being chased by a hungry mountain lion, or anger when someone threatens you—this is because your emotions are meant to help you survive, and when you are angry, you are more likely to stand up for yourself, or when you are in danger, you need to be able to act in a way that will keep you alive. By creating the necessary emotions, you can usually begin to persuade those around you to act; however, you want or need them to. If you need someone to be angry and act, you figure out the best way to instill that anger. If you need help, you instill a sense of obligation or guilt. If you need to keep someone complacent, you want them to feel content and relaxed. A lot of the time, people will instill these emotions through stories, quotes, and vivid language. For example, if you are at a fundraiser to benefit a children’s hospital that sees a large number of patients with cancer, you may be told stories of how being on that floor is a parent’s worst nightmare and that sometimes, what they want more than anything else is to see their children doing something normal—they want that sense of normalcy to cling to because they do not know if they will be taking their children home at the end of the journey, and some people know for sure that they will not be taking their children home. The speaker may involve photos of sick children and sobbing parents, all designed to make the audience sad or guilty, especially if they have their own children at home. In their guilt and sadness for those parents in the story or slideshow, more people are willing to donate. Logos An appeal to logic and reason is the final form of rhetoric. With Logos, you are seeking to establish as much reason as possible that cannot be denied to do whatever you are requesting. You may point out the numbers and facts that support what you are asking for, or otherwise use studies that support your opinion. Those using Logos have a tendency to throw as much data as possible at the other person, hoping that something will stick. Of the forms of persuasion, this may seem like the most valid—after all, how do you fake statistics and studies? However, the problem with this form of persuasion can arise in the fact that it is incredibly easy to misconstrue or misuse statistics, especially if those statistics are not being fact checked, or the listener does not feel the need to question them. For example, consider the difference between correlation and causation— you can present two different statistics as correlation, but many people will immediately assume that there is causation, despite the fact that there may be none at all and the similarities in statistics may be nothing but coincidence .Perhaps the most easily imagined form of this is to consider that as the sales of ice cream increase, so does the rate of violent crime. To someone not familiar with statistics or correlation vs. causation, they may automatically assume that ice cream and crime are linked. However, they both are simply results of the temperature rising. Ice cream sales tend to go up during the hot summer months, but crime also happens to go up as the heat makes people’s tempers shorter than ever. They are not actually related at all beyond both having the same root cause. Chapter 5: Influencing Others with the Science of Persuasive Psychology Thus far, we have thoroughly discussed the concepts and techniques behind how to persuade others, but have not actually looked at the act of being persuasive. There is more to persuasion than just theory, and while the theory is important, there should also be equal, or more, consideration given to the methods through which you can be persuasive. These methods will utilize the principles of persuasion and rhetoric, but they will also serve as instructions on how to be persuasive in general. You cannot simply say that you must appeal to emotions and then leave it at that—there are other persuasive techniques that exist. We will be taking some time to look at how the one being influenced takes the persuasion offered. You will be seeing why and how these methods work and how to use them. You will be considering exactly how you can influence the decisions that other people make without having to coerce or force the other party to do what you are asking. Instead, you will be focusing on how best to convince them that they ought to have a certain mindset or make a certain decision. Within this chapter, you will take a look at how persuasive psychology is built up, specifically looking at the emotionally intelligent leader, who is able to gather followers with ease, and then extrapolating beyond that particular individual to others as well. You will see how emotional intelligence encourages people to become persuasive individuals that they are without ever having to coerce or force. After painting the background to what persuasive psychology utilizes, you will be guided through four different methods that you can use to ensure that you can persuade others to do as you wish. As you proceed, keep in mind that one of the most defining differences between persuasion and manipulation is that the one being persuaded can always choose not to do what is being requested. The persuader honors free will, and while the persuader may try to guide the individual toward what they want, it will never happen in a forced manner. Saying no to the request is still an acceptable result. Persuasive Psychology and Influence Consider, for a moment, the most influential person that you personally know. They may be someone that you regularly interact with—a teacher, a boss, or a friend. What makes them so influential? The answer may not be that they are smart, funny, or handsome—but rather, they are emotionally intelligent. Emotionally intelligent individuals tend to be far more likely to convince other people to do what they want or need simply because they know how to present themselves .They know how best to interact with others and are able to sense the best way to proceed. Interestingly enough, many of the actions that the emotionally intelligent individual uses to try to persuade others happen to line up almost perfectly with the principles of persuasion and with rhetoric. They know how to utilize those particular techniques almost instinctively, and the end result is someone who is incredibly skilled at persuasion. This also happens to lead these emotionally intelligent individuals to be the ones that others go to for guidance as well. If you knew that your friend always seemed to make the right decision, after all, you would likely go to them any time that you felt like you were at a crossroads and were unsure of what to do next. This is simply because you trust that friend’s judgment and know that they would not lead you astray. Effectively, then, your ability to be persuasive with other people will naturally increase simply by learning to be emotionally intelligent. That is perhaps the best way to naturally increase your persuasiveness without having to consciously think about how to persuade others. When you do have to think about it, however, the best way to figure out how to persuade someone is to figure out the best approach. Are you looking to lead someone to a decision that requires you to be authoritative? This would be if you were attempting to sell someone on something. Are you looking to get a friend to do a favor for you? You may want to use an emotional appeal to make them feel like they need to help someone that they care about. Do you want to make a whole crowd choose an action that you are attempting to push? If so, you may want to use loaded words and stories in an attempt to get them all motivated the same. Do you need a single person to do you a favor? Start by asking if you can help them. As you can see, there are several different techniques that must be used at any given moment to help make your message more persuasive. However, you must be able to figure out the best way to convince other people. You can simplify the act of figuring out how best to convince someone to do something into a few steps. First, you will start by identifying the target for your persuasion. Then, you must figure out the nature of the persuasion that you will be using—are you persuading someone as an authority that should be listened to or as someone that is deserving of help? Next, you must figure out how best to get whatever you are hoping to get, and lastly, you must use the methods and techniques you have decided upon. Identify the Identifythe Identifythe target of nature ofthe method of persuasion persuasion persuasion Create an Appeal to Needs What drives you to act in your life to survive? We are not talking about things that you enjoy right now, but rather, what compels you more than anything else? The answer to this is a need—your needs keep you motivated to act toward fulfilling them. You will always be motivated to find food when you are hungry, for example, or to find shelter when you are too cold. This is because you have basic human needs to meet that keep you alive. Your needs can vary from physical needs to keep yourself alive all the way to how to feel fulfilled, and ultimately, these motivators are incredibly compelling. Before delving into creating and appealing to needs, let’s stop and go over the basic hierarchy of needs. Take a look at the pyramid below: As you can see, at the base, you have the most important needs. These are the needs for food, water, air, shelter, warmth, and reproduction. These are the bare minimum needs to stay alive and to reproduce, as is the biological imperative. In general, you must meet the bottom three tiers of needs before you can begin to work on yourself. Self actualization Love and belonging Physiological needs Each of these categories manage different sorts of needs for you, and ultimately, people are always striving to do better and move from one to the next. These categories encompass needs such as: e Physiological needs: The need to survive and be healthy physically—food, water, air, shelter, reproduction, warmth, etc. e Safety needs: The need to feel safe and secure, such as the need for steady access to resources and health e Love and belonging needs: The need to feel like you belong with others—this is friendship, intimacy, and a sense of connection with others e Esteem needs: This is a need for respect and recognition e Self actualization needs: This is a need to be the best person that you can be Ultimately, people are always striving for the top—self actualization. However, you cannot work toward self actualization if you are hungry or unsafe. You need to secure the bottommost needs before you can work at the top. When you want to create a need that you can use, you may find that sometimes, identifying a previously existing need can be easier .However, you can also create a sense of urgency to meet one of these needs. For example, imagine that you are selling a car. You are really working to persuade someone to get a very specific car, though you know that they are not particularly interested in it. One way to create an appeal to a need is to mention that the car that the people are interested in does not have the best ratings in terms of safety. You point out that the car has been known to underperform in accidents, and that the one that you are pushing for tends to be safer simply because it is bigger and sturdier, or it has better safety ratings. By appealing to that need for safety, you are more likely to get them to agree to buy that particular car. If they are not concerned about safety, you can appeal to a need to belong—you can point out that other people also tend to prefer that one car that you would like to sell over the one they are interested in and provide the evidence to support that claim. Loaded Words Another commonly used method to persuade other people is through using loaded language. This is the act of using words or language that has very specific connotations in hopes of changing the way that the other person perceives what is being talked about. Effectively, you are using words that typically attract attention or are seen as particularly beneficial bonuses. Imagine that you are trying to sell a new baby food brand. You have worked hard to develop the image for the food, but you realize that people do not usually buy a food that they know nothing about—they tend to go with trusted brands that they know and can trust will be safe or deliver what they wanted. You may be stuck trying to figure out how best to break into the scene to actually get on the market and convince people to buy. One such method of convincing others is through using loaded words and images. You will want to make sure that you are constantly utilizing words or images that are perceived as strongly positive. For example, think about what it is that parents want for their newborn children. You may acknowledge that most parents want to ensure that their children are happy and healthy and that they are not exposed to chemicals or other additives that may make them sick or cause a reaction. After all, babies are believed to be incredibly fragile, and because of that, parents tend to go all out in making sure that their children only have the best. You may, then, decide that you will be appealing to that desire for all natural products. You take your advertising campaign to emphasize that you use natural, organic, non GMO food products with the bare minimum ingredients necessary. You push that your food is healthy and simple, encouraging parents to be more inclined to buy simply because they know that they can read all of the ingredients on the label. Effectively then, when you want to use loaded language, you are appealing to emotion. You are making someone feel like they are making the right choice in deciding to go with whatever you are requesting that they use. This means that you are better able to get people to see things your way and better able to persuade simply because you know how to activate emotions. You will always choose the loaded language that will activate the feelings that you need present to play upon. Anchor Biases An anchor bias is a cognitive bias that ends up being incredibly influential. Effectively, you want to make something seem like a good idea or plan simply by making it seem reasonable in comparison to the anchor point. When you do this, you are generally setting an anchor point that you use to be a reference point for whatever you are trying to persuade someone else to do. This is best understood when looking at the negotiation of pay. You may be asking for a raise during your next review at work. Perhaps you want a 10% raise because of the productivity you have put in and the rate at which you are able to retain valuable clients. You figure out exactly why and how you want to argue for this particular number, but all that is left is the delivery of the argument. You need to present your information in a way that makes it seem realistic or reasonable. In a negotiation, it is common knowledge that you rarely ever take the first offer—you are usually able to counter offer, and then meet somewhere in the middle. This means that if you ask for that flat 10% raise right off the bat, your chances of actually getting it are slim. However, if you are able to make an anchor point that makes that 10% raise seem reasonable, you may actually stand a chance. The best way to do this is to always ask for more. You may go in and ask for a 15 or 20% raise instead, knowing that the number will be cut down. When you ask your boss for that raise, you will likely be shot down immediately, followed by a counteroffer of 5 10% simply because your original asking price was so high. This means that the other party is going to feel more inclined to give what you initially wanted since it is still significantly less than you originally asked for. In the end, you get your 10% raise, all by asking for far more than you were actually interested in. By shooting high right away, you make anything that comes afterward seem reasonable. You see this during sales pricing as well. Several different stores have pricing strategies that involve marking up prices only to discount them back to market value. This means that you see that you are getting a 20 30% discount, but only because the prices were inflated 20 30% in the first place. At the end of the day, you are paying market value, but you feel better about it because the anchor point of full price seemed like far more. Ask First What You Can Do for the Other Person Perhaps one of the simplest techniques that you can use to persuade someone to do something for you is to appeal to reciprocity. People naturally feel inclined to return favors when they have received them in the first place, and you can use this tendency in order to influence other people to do whatever it is that you want or need them to do. You may be able to convince someone to take a shift for you at work just by covering their extended lunch break, for example. This is a popular technique for the emotionally intelligent leaders. They make themselves sound entirely focused on making someone else feel better about doing a favor by offering to do one first. You may find that you have a friend that is always happy to help you or is the first to volunteer when you voice that you have a problem. Emotionally intelligent leaders make it a point to do this simply because it sets up a standard of camaraderie—you make it clear that you are interested in the other person simply by volunteering occasionally to help them out. Not everyone is willing to help out when asked or needed, but if you are willing to do so, even occasionally, other people will be more inclined to help you out when you need a favor. After having offered, you will then know that the individual that you have helped will be more inclined to help you in the future as well. For example, imagine that you know that you have a vacation coming up, and you do not want to board your dog. You also know that you have a friend that will be going on a trip just a week or so before you and your friend has cats. You may volunteer to go and check on the cats several times during your friend’s trip when your friend talks about having to look for someone to come in and take care of them. They will need litter cleaned a few times and will need daily food and water, but beyond that, they will be fine on their own. Your friend graciously accepts and then asks you to let her know if you will need any help in the near future. You reply that you actually will need help soon and that you need someone to take care of your dog. Your friend volunteers to keep the dog at her house for a few days while you are on your trip, and you no longer have to worry about boarding your dog because you know that your dog will be safe and happy with your friend. This technique tends to be better for those who need help from a friend or someone that they know personally just because it involves one on one interaction. However, you can also see this play out on a larger scale as well. Perhaps you are a manager, and your employees are all asking for an increase in pay across the board. You take it to your higher ups, and in return, your employees all see that you have their back. They then make it a point to always help whenever they are asked to do so and they are willing to go above and beyond when requested. To take advantage of this technique, you are best served by always asking how you can help other people whenever it is not a strain on you or what you need to do. If you are able to always ask other people what they want or need, you can make sure that you are setting up good relationships with other people, and with that good relationship established, you will be far more able to get them to do whatever it is that you needed. Chapter 6: What is NLP? Have you ever gone through the effort of trying to communicate with someone else that does not speak the same language as you? Perhaps you speak English, and the other person speaks Chinese. The person speaking Chinese is desperately gesturing for something, but you are entirely unsure what it is that they need. They gesture frantically, but you never figure it out. You make many guesses—you offer a phone, and they shake their head. You offer water, and they shake their head. No matter what you offer, the other person becomes more and more annoyed or frustrated because he or she cannot get through to you. Eventually, the other person storms off without having ever gotten whatever it is that he needed and you are left wondering what it was that was so desperately needed in the first place. Now, imagine that same exchange, but you are both the English and Chinese speaker—one half of you only speaks in English while the other desperately tries to communicate in Chinese. Neither side is able to communicate with the other, and both end up disjointed, frustrated, and without any proper communication. This is actually what does happen in your mind. Your conscious mind thinks in one way, and the unconscious mind thinks entirely differently. You may want to be setting up a life to be happy and successful, but in reality, your unconscious has never received the message. As a result, you find that your unconscious continuously sabotages you. Your emotions do not line up with your goals. Your body language does not fit. You simply run into complication after complication, despite the fact that you know what you want. Keep in mind that your unconscious mind is not meant to be your adversary. It is not something that needs to be tamed or controlled. Rather, it is something to harness and work within tandem. However, this means that you need to learn to communicate with it appropriately. If you can figure out the right way to communicate with that unconscious part of yourself, you can get it lined up with your conscious desires and expectations. You can get it to help you achieve your goals. It is not a matter of your unconscious being out to get you or subvert your attempts to happiness; it is a matter of you do not know how best to communicate with your unconscious mind to get what you want. Neuro Linguistic Programming This is where neuro linguistic programming comes in. NLP is designed to help you facilitate getting the results that you want and need. It helps you figure out how best to act in ways that are conducive to your success. Those who practice NLP say that the unconscious mind is what drives you to achieve your goals, so long as you are able to communicate those goals effectively. NLP recognizes that both the conscious and unconscious minds are important and serve their own roles. The Unconscious The Conscious Mind Mind The goal getter The goal setter Figures out how to achieve goals and Decides what is Spurs action toward desired understood desires NLP helps to bridge that gap between the two, acting as a sort of translator, so your conscious desires are communicated to the unconscious mind in order to ensure that your mind works together rather than against each other. By working together, you will find that you are far more likely to see your desired results simply because you are not running into the problem of having the two parts of your mind clash. Effectively, neuro linguistic processing is a method of learning to communicate with the unconscious. You are learning to become fluent in your unconscious mind’s method of communication so you can finally tell it what you want. It allows for that communication with yourself, but also facilitates the communication with others as well. This means that you can use the processes learned during the practice of NLP to also communicate with the unconscious minds of others as well. You can implant thoughts, facilitate behaviors, and encourage changes in lifestyles all by learning how to tap into the unconscious minds of others. While this may sound manipulative, you actually see people paying others to give them the NLP treatment. People will pay practitioners to help them overcome phobias or bad habits. People can be taught to overcome emotions, create new coping methods, and more all by interacting with someone fluent in NLP. For example, imagine that you have severe anxiety because, as a child, you went up to present something, but you really needed to use the bathroom. You could not go before the presentation, and as you gave it, you accidentally had an accident. Everyone laughed at you, and ever since, you have been terrified of ever getting involved in presentations. Being in front of a crowd became something that you could not possibly bring yourself to do. You failed several assignments all through school because you simply would refuse to present. You would do the work, but you would not go up to present it. Obviously, there are plenty of job choices during which you would never have to be in front of a crowd, but if you happened to choose a job that would regularly put you in front of people to deliver reports, you may find that you struggle. You know that you are not a child anymore and that realistically, you would not be wetting yourself again any time soon, but you cannot get over that feeling of being laughed at and horrified. As a solution, you may have spoken to an NLP practitioner. The practitioner would have access to several tools that could help you process that trauma in order to get past it. You could reframe the situation, learning to laugh at it instead of feeling traumatized. You could learn to create anchors that will have you begin to feel an entirely different feeling when you go up to present. No matter the method, there are several tools that can be used to help you get over that trauma. This is just one example of a time that NLP can be used to benefit. However, it can also be used in ways that are harmful. Manipulators love the tools of NLP because they grant access to the unconscious mind. The manipulator can use NLP techniques to create tendencies to obey almost mindlessly. They can create tendencies to give the manipulator exactly what he or she wants. The manipulator will be able to communicate with the unconscious mind without ever tripping the alarms of the conscious mind. Effectively, the manipulator is able to completely bypass the conscious and tell the unconscious exactly what is expected—and the unconscious will comply. Without any clear way to communicate, the individual will be left frustrated, wondering why they keep behaving the way that they are with no clear answer. The Keys to NLP For NLP to be effective, there are a few steps that need to be followed. These are the keys to NLP that will help you figure out how to access the mind. At this point, you are being shown a brief overview of what needs to happen. There are techniques that will more or less use these steps on their own and other steps that will seek to change things up a bit. However, at the heart of things, these must happen. These three steps, the keys to being able to practice NLP, are being able to examine and identify beliefs, choosing an appropriate anchor, and then setting that anchor in an efficient manner. Set the anchor If you can master these three simple steps, you will find that the more Identify and examine beliefs Choose an anchor specific techniques seem to fall into place with ease. You will be able to convince people to do almost anything, simply by knowing how to get into the other person’s mind. This is a strategic endeavor, but once you are able to follow that strategy, you will find that the control that you can exert over both yourself and others around you is far more than you had access to ever before. You will become the master over your own behavior, while also having the power and access to other people to be a master over them as well. You can effectively use these NLP techniques and strategies to figure out how best to win the long game. Examine beliefs First, you are figuring out the information at hand. This is where you start to piece together what you or the other person think or feel surrounding a certain event or situation. You may find that the other person is highly anxious about socializing and being in front of crowds. When in front of a crowd, they tend to melt down and freak out. You know this and acknowledge it. You will be examining beliefs to figure out why that is felt. In this case, it may link back to that one incident of wetting herself in front of a crowd and then being mortified any time she is under public scrutiny. If you are attempting to use NLP on yourself, which is a valid technique that many people will use, you may take this time to identify the emotion that you have that you wish was not problematic. You may figure out that you tend to feel angry during certain situations, and because of that anger, you struggle to really communicate with other people effectively. That lack of communication usually has the unfortunate result of causing problems in your relationships. As you identify those feelings, you will find that you can figure out where the problem lies. In figuring them out, you can start to figure out how best to target and destroy them. In NLP, this process usually involves the use of anchors—points that are directly related to a certain event or feeling. An anchor for your stress, for example, maybe you bite your nails out of habit, but after a lifetime of biting your nails when stress, just the act of absently biting your nails can make your anxiety begin to flare up. Choose an anchor Knowing that you will be under the influence of several anchors already, certain situations or actions that cause you to feel a certain emotion, it is time to figure out which anchors and emotions you can use to overcome the problem. If you know that you have an anger issue, you may go through the effort of learning how to combat that anger issue through triggering new emotions instead. Whenever you would feel yourself getting angry, then you would make sure that you trigger your anchor, and that would then cause you to feel something else. Effectively, if you are familiar with basic psychology, you are conditioning yourself. You are effectively training yourself to act a certain way in response to certain situations, and in doing so, you are able to make sure that you can overcome the negative feelings that have been holding you down. If you have bad habits in relation to your emotions, you can begin to counter them. You can figure out how to create new, healthier habits that trigger you to behave in new, healthier ways. You can figure out how best to protect yourself from your negative emotions so you can heal and move on in life. Your new anchor can be just about anything. You could use an affirmation or word that you repeat to yourself to help keep yourself under control. It could be a movement or an action that you use to remind yourself to stay under control, such as snapping your wrist with a rubber band whenever you find that your anger is getting out of hand. It could be a scent that makes you feel secure. It can even be a certain thought or memory that you return to during times of distress. When you choose an anchor, you want to make sure that it is something that you can regularly access for maximum impact. You may be best served with a short phrase that you use or a motion of your hands. That is something that you can do subtly and at any point in time. Set an anchor Finally, you must figure out how to set your anchor. This is where you see the most deviation in your behaviors and techniques. There are several different methods that can be used in order to set a good anchor point for you or for those around you, and how you decide to do so will largely be dependent upon what you are hoping to do and how you are dealing with. You may choose to use visualization if you are working with someone intentionally, with the other person knowing what you are doing. You may choose to use something more along the lines of mirroring and subtle mimicry and emotional triggers if you want to be entirely unnoticed. You may choose to do something like intentionally reframing a memory from negative and traumatic into something funny if you want to change your own way of thinking and your own emotional reaction. Ultimately, the method that you choose will largely be subject to who you are attempting to persuade and how you want to go about it. If you want to make it a point to, for example, persuade a stranger to buy something that you want them to, you may make it a point to trigger a mirroring relationship—do not worry if you do not know how to do this. It will be discussed in Chapter 8. From there, you can subtly influence him to nod his head by nodding your own head, making the other person’s mindset far more likely to be agreeable, and leading to the other person being influenced to nod along with you without ever realizing that you had influenced and encouraged that decision. Whether you want to control yourself or someone else, you always want to choose an anchor that is simple and easily implemented, but not so common that it will be randomly triggered by strangers during the course of the day. While you probably could trigger someone to make a certain face every time you do a very specific and common movement, such as giving a thumbs up, it would not be particularly kind or ethical to do so. You would be triggering the other person in a way that will likely be distracting and problematic. After all, no one wants to be grimaced at every time they give a thumbs up to someone else. The History of NLP NLP, like nearly any psychological technique, has changed drastically from creation to what you now know and see today. While the root is still the same, there are different ways that the thoughts and techniques are approached now compared to what was seen back when it was first founded in the 1970s. This chapter will provide you with a brief overview of how NLP has changed and what you can expect if you were to use NLP today. Ultimately, you can think of NLP as what it was during creation and within the four waves of NLP. The Creation of NLP Created in 1972 by two psychotherapists named Richard Bandler and John Grinder, this process was originally designed to model several other therapeutic processes at the time. In particular, it referenced and developed from techniques such as gestalt therapy, hypnotherapy, and systemic family therapy. All of these came together to create an approach that would address two specific things: Why are psychotherapists special or skilled in influencing others? How can that specialty be transferred to other normal people without any formal training in psychology? These two thoughts then triggered the beginning of the development of NLP. IN particular, people were taught to look at each of the aforementioned psychotherapy processes. Bandler and Grinder drew from those different forms of psychotherapy and pulled out any processes or techniques that they thought were critical in making the therapist so powerful. They identified the patters in communication and attitudes and were able to then create and build a list of techniques and beliefs drawing from those forms of psychotherapy. Thus, NLP was born. NLP as primarily existed within four specific waves, during which different aspects were focused on or developed. These four waves are important to understand in order to truly understand what NLP was and what it has become. e Wave 1: NLPure: In the first wave of NLP, you see the original NLP as developed by Bandler and Grinder. This is the purest form, during which success and enthusiasm were the most important factors that were pushed. e Wave 2: NLPt: In the second wave, you see NLP used as an application in psychotherapy. It is commonly referred to as neuro linguistic psychotherapy, and it began in 1989. This was all about making sure that people had a healthy and happy approach and view of life. e Wave 3: NLPeace: This third wave, NLPeace, arose in 1992, with a focus on spirituality. Instead of focusing on how to fix the mind itself, it was focusing on how to find meaning in life and figure out how to connect spiritually. e Wave 4: NLPsy: Finally, the fourth wave encompasses the use of neuro linguistic processing as a form of psychology. Beginning in 2006, this was used to being to identify psychological patterns. It requires a master’s degree in psychology, for a qualification to practice psychotherapy, and also an NLP master training qualification. Effectively, when you see someone that practices NLPsy, you know that they have gone through years of schooling in order to be as effective as possible when it comes to offering treatment. When you seek out NLP treatment from a professional, you will likely face someone that is trained in fourth wave NLP. This is good—they are licensed to help you and can enable you to be the healthiest you that you can be. However, remember that NLP itself was designed to be accessible even to the average person. While you are not qualified to diagnose people if you have not gone to school to become licensed to do so, you will still be able to develop an affinity for several NLP processes so you can use them effectively and in ways that you know are beneficial to others around you or to yourself. Chapter 7: NLP Basic Principles to Improve Life Before really delving into the processes of NLP and how you can utilize them, it is important to recognize that there are several principles that you will have to keep in mind. When you want to use NLP, you must meet these principles if you want to be able to be successful. After all, accessing other people’s unconscious minds will require you to be patient, flexible, and willing to spend the time to do so effectively. You will need to have a clear plan ready for yourself so you can actively address and live by the rules that you are seeking to make use of. Think of these as your guiding processes that will help you to make sure that you are able to use NLP. These will be your founding principles that you will live by if you want to be able to tap into the unconscious. These will guide you in being successful, whether you want to improve your own life or convince someone else to do something specific. No matter what you choose to do, you will be able to do so, if you keep these steps in mind. In particular, the steps that will be addressed here are being able to know your outcome, take action, maintain sensory acuity, have flexibility, and live by a physiology of excellence. With these five principles, NLP will be successful for you. This chapter will guide you through learning how to utilize these principles in your own life. You will be able to help yourself. You will be able to help others. Above all, you will be able to be effective and successful. Know your outcome The first and most important place to start when you are attempting to live with the utilization of NLP is knowing your outcome. This is effectively figuring out exactly what you want, how you will get it, and why you want it. If you do not know what the outcome you want is, how can you possibly hope to ever achieve it? If you do not know that you want to be a lawyer, for example, can you possibly reasonably expect yourself to go through law school and build up all that debt, only to find out after the fact that law was your passion after all? No—no one in their right mind would ever put themselves through law school without ever knowing that they wanted to be a lawyer or that their true goal in life was to be a lawyer. People may go through law school because they have been told their whole life that they should go to law school, but even those people grew up with the expectation of being a lawyer. No one goes to law school without the expectation or desire to become that person. Just like no one would ever expect that you must know your own outcome and desires if you want to succeed. You need to figure out exactly what you want in life so you can figure out how to get it. Do you want to be rich? Do you want to find love? Maybe you want to be a parent, or you want to become a firefighter. No matter what the dream is, you need to know and vocalize it to yourself if you want it to become a reality. If you want to be rich, you can tell yourself that. If you want to be happy, you can tell yourself that, too. What your goal is in life is not as important as knowing what that goal is. That knowledge is power and will help you during your process. If you are using NLP for other people, you may want to know what your end goal for that person is. Do you want them to be happy? Do you want them to buy that car you are selling? Maybe you want them to break up with their narcissistic partner. No matter what it is you want, you need to know what it is if you hope to make it happen. Once you know what you want, it is time to form it in a way that you can act upon it. This is effectively just coming up with a way to structure your desires so you can act upon them. When you do this, you must meet certain specific criteria to ensure that the outcome is well formed. This is a fancy way of saying that if you want your goal to be actionable and attainable, you need to word it in the proper manner. These criteria are critical to making sure that you are able to act accordingly. These criteria are: e Positive oriented: Your goal must be focused on what you do want, not what you would like to avoid. For example, you must state that you want to find love, versus you don’t want to be alone any longer. Shifting this to a positive instead of a negative gives you something to work toward instead of something to avoid. e Sensory specific: As we continue along the NLP path, you will begin to see that every method of influence on someone else, whether it is on yourself or on someone else, is sensory. You must figure out which senses you will be targeting and how those senses will perceive when you have been successful at achieving your goal. Perhaps this will be that you can see that you have a partner if your end goal is to find love. If you want to sell that car, perhaps you decide that the sensory input will be having the paperwork with the signatures in your hand. Try to address how each of your five senses will interact with the outcome when it has been achieved. This helps you be able to truly visualize what you want. Contextual: This involves making sure that you know the context under which you will be successful. You are acknowledging what has to happen if you want to be successful. Where will it happen? When? How? Who will you be with? When you know the context of what you are seeking, you will be able to acknowledge what you need to do to set up the environment properly to ensure that you do happen to get whatever you are hoping to achieve. Self achievable: You must make sure that the goal you want is one that you can set into action on your own without the influence of other people. You may need to make sure that other people are doing something, but can you do so? You must have access to the resources that you will need to achieve your goal. Ecological: This is as simple as asking three specific questions for yourself: Is it good for you? Is it good for other people? Is it for the greater good? Remember, NLP is all about bettering the world and those who are using it. While it is often used as a tool for manipulation and controlling others, that is not always the intention. Worthwhile: Finally, you must make sure that whatever the outcome that you are trying to achieve is worthwhile. Is it something that will actually be useful and positive to you? It does not have to be useful on a daily basis, but you should be able to see some good from whatever it is. You may have enhanced other people’s lives, allowing your friend to no longer be terrified of crowds, which indirectly improves your own life because your friend is happier and healthier. On the other hand, you may directly address a problem of your own in an attempt to better yourself, and that is okay too. So long as it is effective, either directly or indirectly, it is good enough. Take action The next step to making sure that you are able to be successful in using NLP is to take action. This is something that may seem like common sense, but many people entirely miss this step altogether. You must be willing to act if you hope to see any results. If you want to ensure that you can actually change your life or change the behaviors of someone else, you must figure out reasons to work or do something. Oftentimes, people fall into the trap Of inaction—they feel like they cannot possibly succeed, and therefore they fall victim to procrastination. However, this is your mind’s attempt to avoid action in order to protect yourself from failure. When you protect yourself in this way, it is easy to make excuses and act like it happened for a reason you may tell yourself that you are too dumb to really make a difference, or that you will fail even if you try. Well, guess what: Failure happens. People fail all the time, but that is not inherently bad. When you fail, you learn. When you learn, you become better prepared for your next attempt. It is okay to fail, so long as you learn from that failure and do not let it define you. Effectively, then, you want to live through learning from that failure and not letting the fear of failure keep you locked in inaction. When you are practicing NLP, you must act. If you refuse to act, nothing gets done. Nothing changes. People’s behaviors remain the same. You fail. NLP is not passive—it requires constant action and effort, and for that reason, you must be willing to go through the motions and make whatever it is that you want happen. Sensory acuity Next, you must learn sensory acuity. This is effectively learning to cue into all of the important body language that you will need to understand if you hope to be able to use NLP. NLP is all about being able to look at someone else, understand their mindset and processes, and then use those processes in order to figure out how to influence the other person’s mind as well. Stop and consider for a moment what body language is—it is unconscious movements that are designed to convey very specific meanings. Your unconscious mind is largely responsible for your body language—if you are anxious, your body language will convey that. If you are happy, your body language will convey that. This means that if you learn how to read the body language of someone else, you will be able to read the state of their unconscious mind. This is because body language and actions are directly influenced by thoughts. They exist within a cycle—thoughts influence feelings and those feelings influence behavior. Effectively, then, you can learn to track the thoughts by learning to identify behavior. You can also take this one step further by learning to change thoughts by influencing behavior as well. Thoughts <= Effectively, then, sensory acuity is the ability to focus entirely externally. Think about what happens most of the time when someone is telling you a story. If you are not trained in effective listening, you may make it a point to constantly be coming up with arguments that you can use to make a certain point in response. You may feel like you are listening, but in reality, your mind is also busy trying to come up with some sort of reaction or counterargument. This is problematic—you are not paying close enough attention to the other party, and you run some serious risks in doing so. However, you can learn to defeat this. You can learn to focus entirely on listening instead. When you focus on sensory acuity, focusing on what the other person is doing as they talk, you are paying complete attention. You see all of those minute shifts in body language. You are seeing the other person change up what they are doing in response to you. You are seeing those subtle signs that may betray a lie, or that say that the other person is uncomfortable with the line of questioning but is desperate to try to remain open in communication. Effectively, then, you must learn to always listen attentively. You must learn how to recognize these aspects of body language so you can use them as feedback for yourself. In learning to recognize that body language, you can effectively allow yourself to respond appropriately, or to glean all of that information that you will need in order to be successful with the attempts to persuade with NLP. Behavioral Flexibility Another important aspect of NLP is flexibility. NLP is not an exact science simply because no two people are the same. People are complex, and so too are their minds. One person may be entirely comfortable with talking about a personal issue while the other is terrified to mention similar issues. You may find that some people are happy to comply without resistance, and others are completely unresponsive to your best attempts to influence. Because no two minds are the same, you must be willing to engage in a little trial and error. You cannot simply decide that you will come up with a one size fits all approach to accessing other people’s minds—you must be willing to entertain several different possibilities and to change things up when you hit a roadblock. Oftentimes, people fail at this—they simply stubbornly refuse to ever engage in anything other than what they have originally set out to do, but the results never change. If it failed the first and second time, why do you think that the same attempt would pass the next time? If you never try anything different, the change will never arrive. You need to be able to focus on change if you want to be successful at NLP. You need to be flexible in your own behaviors. You need to be flexible in what you are willing to try. This helps beyond just learning NLP, too—when you use this, you are effectively making yourself more flexible in general. You are teaching yourself to cope with failure or the unexpected with ease. You will no longer be afraid of failing or feeling like you cannot try anything else. It helps you become more likely to succeed simply because you are willing to step out of your comfort zone and mix things up when you need to. If you are unwilling to make concessions or change your best attempts at dealing with a situation, all you are going to do is keep yourself stubbornly rooted in failure and control rather than looking at things as being a chance for improvement. Physiology of excellence Finally, if you want to be successful in your endeavors with NLP, you must be able to operate from a position of health. You need to be feeling physically and mentally sound if you hope to operate at your best, which means that you must be able to take care of yourself. You cannot take care of others if you cannot take care of yourself, so you must be willing to maintain that physiology of excellence. Just as you are told that you must put your own oxygen mask on before tending to your children on an airplane, you must be willing to take care of yourself before you are willing to take on the world’s problems. You need to ensure that you are healthy. This means that you must engage in self care. You must make sure that you are healthy. You must make sure that you get the proper rest to maintain yourself. In particular, if you find that your life is not giving you the excellence that you need or that you are not as healthy as you could be, you should put in the time to achieve it. You may need to use some of your own NLP techniques to achieve this, such as teaching yourself to be more diligent about your own sleep or exercise regimen or reminding yourself to eat healthily. However, you owe it to yourself and to those around you that are relying on you to keep yourself healthy. After all, you cannot possibly focus on the other person if you are not feeling well. Besides just being in your own best interest, if you are able to make sure that you are healthy, you will rub off on those that you are with. If you adopt your own healthy lifestyle, those closest to you are more likely to begin to adapt some of those tendencies for themselves as well. Chapter 8: Mind Control with NLP With that understanding of what NLP is and how it can influence you, it is time to begin understanding some of the most common techniques that you can use to control the minds of others. You may choose to control your own mind, influencing your unconscious to behave accordingly to ensure that you can get what you need, or you may be influencing other people to help them instead. No matter who you are attempting to influence, you will be able to do so with these techniques. Keep in mind that some of these may require tweaking between using it for yourself and using it for someone else. As you read through this chapter, you will be introduced to NLP and mind control—you will understand why it works at all. You will be shown how NLP works in order to help control other people. From there, you will then begin to learn how to exact that control over other people as well. You will be guided through four distinct tactics that you can use that wield NLP as a tool in order to influence others. As always, remember that NLP is one of those tools whose value and intent chan entirely change the meaning. If you use NLP from a position of wanting to help others, it is incredibly effective. However, if you want to use it in order to manipulate or hurt others, you will find that you can do far more harm than you may have realized. Keep in mind that playing inside someone else’s mind, no matter what your intention, is something dangerous. It is not something to take lightly or simply do to mess with someone. You should be very deliberate in your acts of controlling others. Free will and someone else’s mind are very personal and private, and that privacy deserves to be respected. NLP to Control Minds Ultimately, NLP is one of the most effective ways to influence someone else's mind. While you will not be able to simply tell someone to do something and get them to do just that or to use someone else’s mind with your own controller to gain absolute control, you are able to heavily influence what someone is willing to do or what they are willing to say or put up with, all by learning to access their minds and prime them to do what you want. You will effectively be able to plant thoughts into their minds, having them fit perfectly and neatly as if they were always intended to be there. a Effectively, then, this is an incredibly powerful influence—it will enable you to get other people to do almost anything that you want them to do if you know what you are doing. You can dispel anxiety, or you can use it to instill fear for a tighter grip over someone. You can use it to free someone from stress or to make them feel entirely powerless. This is because you are accessing the unconscious mind. NLP is effectively a form of hypnosis—you are gently and covertly lulling the other person into a state of suggestiveness, during which you can bypass the conscious mind in order to install your own desires into someone else. You can make sure that the other person is willing to think or feel whatever it is that you want them to do just by making sure that you know what you are doing. In fact, people have used these techniques to convince people to do nearly anything. All you need to be able to do is lull them into a state of relaxation and trust. In fact, one of the most important parts of being able to install a sense of trust in you. This is known as establishing a rapport with the other person, and if you can do that, you can effectively gain access to the other person’s mind. Ultimately, when someone trusts you, they will not be actively guarding against you or what you might do. This is why developing that rapport is so critical in NLP. When someone practices NLP, they usually spend a period of time building up that rapport so they will be able to tap into the other person’s unconscious mind. You will be able to do this yourself if you are willing to put in the effort. Mirroring First and foremost, you must build up rapport, as mentioned. The best way to do so is through learning to mirror someone. Mirroring is the unconscious mimicking of people that we are close to. Think about how, when one person yawns, their friends or family member that are present are likely to yawn as well—that is a form of mirroring. However, it does not stop there. When two people are close to each other emotionally and truly trust each other, you will find that their breathing rates will synchronize. They will walk together with the same steps and pacing. They will naturally take sips at the same time, or take bites at the same time if they are eating together. They will make the same motions as one another—if one itches their nose, the other will likely itch theirs as well. They may even take the same poses as each other without thinking about it. This is mirroring, and it is incredibly telling. When someone is mirroring someone else, it is because they are able to recognize that they like or trust that other person—that rapport has been built up and is being honored. If you mirror someone else around you, you are likely to do so because you feel like you can trust them. However, this can take a lot of time to build up naturally. Unless you have happened to have an instant connection with the other person, you are likely to need to go through the process of building it yourself. You can do this with just a few simple steps. Create a Follow Find the connection verbal cues punctuator First, you must build up a connection with the other person. You can do this by making sure that you are looking directly at them—you want to be making eye contact and directly acknowledging the other person. You may make it a point to pick up on their own subtle cues—try to synchronize your breathing with the other person as well. As you listen to them, you want to make it a point to nod your head regularly—in particular, you want to do the triple nod. The triple nod tells the other person three things: You are listening, you understand, and most importantly, you agree. You should feel the relationship build up naturally at this point. Next, you want to pick up on the other person’s verbal cues. While you could begin by mimicking their body language, that tends to ring more alarm bells than simply picking up on speech patterns. You will want to make sure that you are talking at the same pitch as the other person and actively following their pace and enthusiasm. As you do so, you will find that the other person will continue longer, especially if you acknowledge them with the triple nod. Finally, the last step in developing that mirroring connection is through finding their punctuator. Everyone has one—it may be as simple as a waggle of the eyebrows when you want to emphasize something. It may be more complex, such as pumping a fist in the air or tilting the head and smiling when you say something that you want emphasized. Nevertheless, identifying this will require some active work on your end. You must be willing to put in the effort to watch the other person’s reactions and tendencies in order to figure out what their own punctuator is. You want to know what they do so you can mimic it yourself. When you figure out their punctuator, you want to use it back the next time you feel like they are likely to use it. If you feel like they are gearing up to waggle their brows at you, do it first. They may not notice it, but they likely will smile and continue to engage with you. They will feel an instant connection to you without truly understanding why, and that is okay. Now, all you need to do is test the connection. You can do this simply by brushing your own shoulder or actively doing something else in an attempt to see if they are willing to copy you. You want to make sure that whatever you choose to do is relatively subtle and that it will not seem out of place, but it also has to be something that you think would not be coincidental. If they follow along, you know that you have done your job well, and you can move on. If not, go back to the beginning and try again. Sometimes, it takes a while to really convince someone to trust you. Anchoring Once you have built a connection with someone else, you are ready to move on to actually attempting to alter the mind of someone else. One of the best ways to do this is through anchoring—when you are anchoring someone to something, you are setting them up to have a specific reaction to a very specific stimulus. This may be that you want them to actively change their mood when you do something, or you want to figure out a way to make them do something in particular in response to their own anxiety or negative feeling. You can use this to make someone more likely to choose a positive decision when they feel out of control, or you can do so in order to get them to do something specific for you. A common tactic of manipulators, for example, is to create a trigger to fear from a very small anchor that is unnoticeable to most—they may use a slight but distinct movement of the hand in order to make the other person feel fear in order to keep the other person under control. However, it can also be sued to prevent bad habits, such as smoking or drinking, or to be a way to cope with anxiety at the moment. Anchoring is quite simple once you are able to develop a rapport with someone else. All you need to do is figure out the right steps and the right feelings to anchor. There are five simple steps to getting someone else anchored to a feeling. Keep in mind that these will take time—you cannot simply expect someone to randomly anchor without much effort. You are effectively conditioning someone, likely without them even being aware of it, and that takes effort and energy to remain undetected. Without further ado, let’s take a look at the five steps of anchoring someone else. ZED E29 XD AD TED Step 1: Choose a feeling You will start this process by figuring out what feeling you wish to instill in someone else. For the purpose of this process, let’s say you want to make your partner feel more confident, so she is not afraid to ask for what she needs when she needs it. You know that she struggles with this and you want to change it. Of course, this feeling could be anything. You could choose to instill anxiety or relaxation. You could choose happiness or sadness. Ultimately, you need to find a trigger that works for you and your situation. Step 2: Choose a trigger This is a fancy way of telling you to figure out a way to install that particular feeling to the other person. You may use storytelling for someone else, telling them a time that brings back feelings of that particular feeling that you want to install. If you want your partner to feel confident, you may reminisce over a period of time during which she was quite confident, describing it until you can see that she seems to be reliving that feeling. Step 3: Choose an anchor Next, you must identify the anchor that you will use. This can use touch, sight, smell, taste, or sound. Most often, sight is the easiest one to instill in someone else, but it still requires enough proximity that you can trigger it when you need it. Figure out what works best for you and the other person. Perhaps, in this case, you choose that you will use a touch to one specific point inside the wrist that is not commonly touched. Step 4: Trigger the feeling At this point, you will be actively triggering the feeling that you are anchoring. You may tell the story during which your partner was confident. You may say things that will help boost your partner’s confidence, such as offering lavish praise for the dinner that was prepared, or pointing out how beautiful she looks that day. You want her to feel confident, so you can then link it to the anchor. You may make it a point to do this several different ways several different times throughout the day. Step 5: Link the anchor Finally, when you can see that the other person is feeling the emotion that you are trying to anchor, you can begin to use the anchor that you want. If you have chosen that quick touch to the inside of your partner’s wrist, you will touch it then. If you have chosen a facial expression, you may make it. As you do this, over time, you will find that your partner makes an association between her confidence and whatever it is that you are anchoring. The trick here is to make sure that any time you trigger that feeling for her, you must pair it with the anchor as well. This is critical if you want it to truly be effective. Keep in mind that this will take time, but it will also be incredibly effective. Pacing and Leading Commonly used in NLP is the act of pacing and leading. Effectively, this is the ability to figure out how best to identify with the other person (such as mirroring to get on the same page) and then guiding them into your own mindset instead of allowing them to maintain their own. As you read this, going over the words written here for you, you may find that you are growing curious about what pacing and leading is and how it can be used. If you now feel curious about pacing and leading, then you have just fallen for it—your current state was acknowledged, and then you were gently guided to a different state—curiosity. This is an incredibly effective technique for one specific reason: You start by mentioning something that is true, acknowledging the state of someone else before actively mentioning something else. It effectively disarms the conscious mind immediately after telling the truth—the conscious no longer sees what is about to be said as potentially threatening because the first part was not. Sometimes, this can be quite overt, as it was in that first reaction, but you can also see it happen far subtler as well. As long as you are able to match the pace and then lead, you will find that this technique can be successful. Of course, you must have that initial rapport built up—if you do not already have a rapport with whomever you are attempting to pace, start with mirroring and then move on to this technique. Change that t he Establish rapport heal aie pace to lead the p P other person Consider for a moment that you are in an argument with your spouse. Your spouse is getting quite angry, and his voice is rising. You are also quite angry but you do not want it to escalate any further. In this instance then, you may make it a point to match the other person’s pace. This does not mean that you should start yelling at your spouse. You need to find another way to match pace. Instead of also yelling out your frustrations, perhaps you return that same pitch and intensity with something slightly less serious. You yell back that you are hungry instead of yelling back that you are angry. Maybe you even mix it up and yell that you are hangry instead. You then start to gradually lessen your own intensity, taking them and their own intensity with you. The sudden change in pace may initially shock your spouse, but you should find that your spouse will follow along with your de escalation most of the time. This can be incredibly useful in many different settings—you may use it in a business setting, listening to what your client has to say, matching pace, and then leading into what you would like to discuss instead. You can use this in advertising, acknowledging what people are doing, and then directing them to ordering the product. You can even use it to gain interest in something, as was done at the beginning of this section. Learning to Read Body Language Finally, one last technique that is regularly used in NLP is to learn how to read and wield body language. Spending the time to understand nonverbal communication means that you will be able to better read what other people are intending. In understanding the intents of other people, you will find that you can also influence and control situations far better as well. When you are able to read body language, you develop the ability to understand what they are thinking. However, when you learn to wield your own body language, you can begin to figure out how best to interact with other people in order to subtly change their own feelings. Think back to mirroring—the other person is likely to follow your lead when you are able to create that connection with them. What if you were to begin to use your own nonverbal cues to help calm them down or change their mindset during that? Maybe you are talking to someone who seems hesitant to make a purchase—you can mirror the other person and subtly nod your head in order to gently push them toward wanting to agree. You can use this to sort of push people into making their final decision. If the other person is still floundering about the idea after you have already attempted to push for a yes, you should probably accept that no and move on. You can use this in several other ways as well. If someone seems annoyed, you can mirror them to get your own rapport with the other person and then use body language to begin to calm them down as well. This is effectively an entirely physical version of the pace and lead, but it can be incredibly effective if you know what you are doing and make it a point to use it well. All you need to do is go through the process, and you will find that you can constantly influence even minor feelings. Chapter 9: Improving Communication Skills Considering just how social that NLP comes across with how much you must be able to interact with the minds of others, it should come as no surprise that good communication skills are critical if you want to be able to use it. These can be difficult to develop if you do not know what you are doing, but you can learn how best to develop the skills that will serve you well if you are willing to put in the effort. In particular, communication skills that are strong can provide you with a myriad of benefits, both within NLP and persuasion and just in your general life. You will be able to communicate with others to be understood better, meaning that you will not run into conflict as much. You will be able to cope with struggles that you may run into. You will be able to ask for what you need. You will be able to better communicate with the unconscious minds of those around you. All you need to do is develop the right skills to do so. It will up your own confidence, and with that improved confidence, you will find that you are much more likely to be happy in your life. In particular, when you need to develop solid communication skills, the best ones to learn are to be able to make meaningful eye contact without forcing or faking it, being able to present yourself as confident and in control, and being able to listen effectively. These, in particular, will help you become far better at being able to communicate in a way that not only facilitates your own understanding of what others want to convey to you but also to make sure that you can tell other people what you need in a clear and meaningful way. Effectively, you will be able to ensure that those around you understand you and are able to respect what you want and need. This chapter will provide you with the necessary information to address those three specific techniques referenced above, providing you with the steps to make these habitual, even if you find that you are intimidated by the idea of making eye contact or trying to be confident. Just keep in mind, whenever you feel doubtful about these methods, that you will be seen as more trustworthy, and that trust is critical if you hope to be seen as reliable by those around you. Making Eye Contact Eye contact is one of those skills that you need to develop to be effective at communicating, but it is also one that people tend to struggle with. Eye contact can make what you are saying more impactful and change how people view you as you speak, but it can also be quite difficult to maintain. If you want to be able to communicate clearly, you need to develop a tolerance for making eye contact, or at least learning how to make eye contact in a way that convinces the other party that you are looking at them. Because so many arguments and conflicts can be linked to a communication mistake, being able to communicate clearly and effectively is critical. With good eye contact and solid communication skills, you will find that people around you are far more willing to listen to what you have to say. They will trust you more frequently and more willingly. They will be more engaged in the conversation and exchange and be more likely to remember you fondly and happily. The beginning of this all is eye contact. After all, if someone does not make strong eye contact with you, you usually assume that they are untrustworthy— it is a sign of deception, and that is not what you want to be portraying if you want to be seen as honest and worthy of listening to. When you use eye contact, you are telling the other person that you are listening and interested. You tell the other person that, at that moment, your focus is on that other person, meaning that they are free to continue. However, people generally struggle with eye contact. If you want to better your ability to make meaningful eye contact, try to follow the following steps. The 50/70 rule At first glance, this may seem confusing since it does not add up to 100, but it actually makes sense. You are looking for eye contact that is good, meaningful, but not staring and uncomfortable. While we all want to receive eye contact to know that we matter and that the other party is actively listening, we also do not want too much eye contact. Too much feels aggressive and uncomfortable, and for that reason, you need to find that middle ground where you give enough eye contact to acknowledge but not so much that you are staring at the other person. This is managed by making eye contact 50% of the time when you speak, and 70% of the time when you are listening. When people speak, they naturally look away as they gather their thoughts. This is because thinking is incredibly difficult to manage. Eye contact is mentally intensive and exhausting, and for this reason, it can get distracting if you try to maintain it constantly during a conversation. By making eye contact half of the time when you speak, you tell the other person that you are talking to them without coming across as rude or challenging. When you are listening, however, you want to be seen as attentive to encourage the other person to keep talking. This is where the 70% rule comes in—you want to look at them more so they feel like they have your attention, but you still want to avoid any actual staring as people generally do not enjoy being stared at. It is distracting, uncomfortable, and can cause problems. Maintain 4 5 seconds of eye contact at a time When you are making that eye contact, make sure that you take a break every 4 or 5 seconds. Doing so breaks the eye contact enough to soften it up without appearing flighty or distracted. By breaking your eye contact every few seconds, you make it clear that you are not trying to be rude or aggressive, and by returning back to the speaker, you tell them that they still have your full attention. Pay attention to where you look When you are taking a break from eye contact, it can be easy to look down or look off quickly. This, however, tends to make you look nervous, and therefore not trustworthy. When you are breaking your eye contact, make it a point to look to the side rather than looking down. Veering off to the side or up and to the side implies thinking, but looking down makes you seem uncomfortable or shy. Immediate eye contact When you want to talk to someone, make sure that you get eye contact before you speak, and make sure that you meet eyes as you begin to speak. You want that eye contact present as the speaking begins. Establish your eye contact, talk, and then look away. Look between the eyes If you find that legitimate eye contact is too uncomfortable to maintain, you can try looking in between the eyes at the bridge of the nose instead. You can usually use this to fool the other person into thinking that you are looking at them, though you are saving yourself from the discomfort of eye contact. Of course, genuine eye contact is always preferred, but you can use this as a crutch while you work on establishing your eye contact more readily and regularly. Listening Effectively Along with making good eye contact, you must also be able to listen effectively if you hope to make good progress with people around you. Listening is another of those skills that many people take for granted—they feel like being able to listen to someone should be easy since we have a sense of hearing. All you need to do is hear, right? Wrong. Hearing is entirely different from listening. Hearing is passive, whereas listening is active. When you are hearing someone, you are simply registering that they are talking. You do not truly understand what is intended or being said, even if you are able to more or less summarize the point of what was said. When you hear someone, you are not necessarily listening to them, but when you are listening to someone, you hear them. Active listening is one of those skills that you can develop then to elevate your hearing to listening. In doing so, you will find that communication, in general, is greatly improved. If you can communicate and listen effectively, you will get a better understanding of what was intended by that conversation because you took the time to listen and inquire about it instead of just making assumptions. How to Listen Actively When you are ready to listen actively, you will have to go through several steps. You effectively want to ensure that you are in a position that is able to listen and pay attention. You want to avoid distractions. You want to give the other person your undivided attention. You want to really listen without contemplating how you will respond to the other person. This may sound simple in theory, but think about what your mind is doing during a conversation—do you find that you end up spending the time trying to figure out how to answer the last point made when the other person is still talking? That is not active listening. That is hearing the other person and then distractedly putting together a rebuttal that may be entirely irrelevant by the end of the conversation, and that is not fair to the other person. To listen actively, then, you will do the following: e Step 1: Face the other person: This is where you give them your undivided attention. No phones or screens present. You will make sure that you are making eye contact and undistracted. e Step 2: Listen: When you are listening, make sure that you are actively paying attention to what the other person is saying. You are not trying to come up with a response during this period—you are simply listening to the other person. e Step 3: Attentive body language: Remember how you would nod when trying to build rapport? That comes back here. Make sure that you nod and give affirmation that you are still listening as the other person talks, but do not interrupt. You also want to make sure that you lean in slightly as you listen to the other person and keep your own body language open and receptive as well. This means no crossing of the arms and paying attention effectively. e Step 4: Ask questions: When you get to the end of the other person’s speech, ask them a few questions. These should be clarifying questions, not questions designed to poke holes in the other person’s argument. Take the time to ask if you understood properly. e Step 5: Form your answer: Do not begin to formulate your response to the other person until you have gotten confirmation that you do, in fact, understand what was said. At that point, take a minute to put together a response, and then go ahead and give it. When you follow these steps, you will find that you are actually far better at understanding what people are saying than you initially thought. You will begin to get more insight from other people. Others will trust you more in conversation with them. They will be more inclined to listen to you as well, and you will be more prepared for your own NLP journey. Remember, if you want to be able to master NLP, you need to be able to listen effectively. Confident Body Language Finally, one last method that you can use to better your own communication with others is to develop confident body language. This means that you need to make sure that you do not close yourself off to contact other people. If you are quite conscientious about your body language, making sure that you portray yourself in a positive and attentive manner, you will find that you are actually far more effective in communicating with others. This section will provide you with several different ways that you can keep your body language effective and confident in order to convince others to show confidence in you as well. If you can attract confidence, you will find that others are more receptive to your attempts to communicate with them. e Stand up tall: The best way to be seen as assertive and confident is to keep your body language tall and open. The best way to do this is to straighten your spine, keep your head straight, and make sure that your legs are nicely spaced. You should stand with your feet at shoulder width apart—doing so makes it clear to other people that you are confident and comfortable with yourself. e Use power poses: Some poses, such as standing calmly and tall while your hands are behind your back, exude confidence without being overpowering. If you are able to use your power poses, you will not only tell other people that you are comfortable and confident, you will also begin to feel more confident as well. e Keep track of your hands: Make sure you watch what your hands are doing. It can be incredibly easy to offend someone with a misplaced gesture or by hiding your hand in your pocket. Be mindful of what you do with them to ensure that you show that you are calm and in control. Make good eye contact: This cannot be more important or more emphasized—you need to be able to make good eye contact to be deemed as confident. Avoid fidgeting: People who are unconfident often find that they are regularly caught up in fidgeting or other nervous behaviors simply because they are uncomfortable. Their body betrays that lack of confidence. Try to stand still and open when you are communicating in order to be seen as confident. Open body language: Make sure that you keep your body language wide open. This means that you cannot be crossing your arms in front of you or otherwise attempting to hide when communicating. You want to ensure that the other person does not see you as dishonest or unwilling to communicate effectively. Chapter 10: NLP for a Successful Life Finally, we have reached the last chapter in this book. You may be feeling like you have far more insight into how you can use NLP and influence other people. However, you can also use it on yourself as well. Do you have some sort of negative trauma that makes it difficult for you to function? Perhaps you feel like you have been held back by your emotions or attempts to get through life. Well, after reading this book, you now have several tools that can help you feel better about who you are, what you want, and how you live life. All you need to do is begin to utilize them. NLP can be used upon yourself regularly enough to make yourself happier, healthier, and more confident. In attracting happiness and confidence, you will find that you are far more successful in your endeavors. You may realize that you are able to better communicate and relate to people after having defeated your anxiety or fears. You may find that you are able to get along better because you can communicate easier. You may find that you are simply feeling better without that concern over how people will see you is gone. When you are able to wield NLP for yourself, you can begin to defeat any traumas that have lingered, holding you back for far too long. You will be able to reframe those traumas, separating from that negativity and figuring out ways to make those memories something far less traumatic. You will be able to anchor yourself in a process that is incredibly similar to the one used for other people, and with using this, you will find that you are able to defeat negative habits. With those habits gone, you will feel far more capable. You will be empowered. You will be successful. You will be using NLP for its truest purpose—to wield to help others and yourself. This chapter will guide you through three techniques that you can use to wield the power of NLP on yourself. You will learn how to use dissociation in order to distance yourself from feelings related to a specific traumatic event or to remove a trigger between an event and a feeling. You will learn to use reframing to change the way that you view an event or memory. Lastly, you will be guided through how to anchor yourself with ease. Dissociation Anxiety can be debilitating, especially if it is an anxiety toward something that you must face regularly. Let’s go back to the example of the woman who had an accident in front of her class and could never get past it again. She may decide, after reading through this book, that she wants to go through the process of dissociation. She wants to figure out how to remove that inherent link between her negative feelings and being able to go in front of crowds once and for all. This process involves three simple steps: Identify the problematic emotion, focus on it and the cause, and then visualize and change. Our friend may identify that she feels shame. She is ashamed that she urinated on herself in class in front of all of her peers, and that shame comes up regularly. She acknowledges that she feels that same shame every time she stands in front of other people, such as her coworkers, or when she has to go to an interview, and in the back of the mind, she is always afraid that it will happen again. Next, she must visualize the triggering event. In this case, she visualizes the incident like it was yesterday—she stops and remembers how she felt when she had to go to the restroom but was too afraid to raise her hand and ask to go. She had been embarrassed that she was going to go during a presentation, and she worried that those around her would be angry that she did not hear the presentation that was given. She imagines elementary school her going up to the front of the class, trying desperately to give her own presentation, even though she really needed to go to the restroom. She hears the sound of the rain pitter pattering on the window in the classroom, and she remembers the sensation of wet warmth spreading down her legs. She remembers the sound of laughter that exploded within the room and the embarrassment and tears as she ran to the bathroom, with urine squelching in her shoes. She remembers this as vividly as possible, and she can feel her face turning bright red in shame as she does. With the memory firmly in mind, it is time to repeat that scene again, but this time, trying to distance herself from the shame that she felt. It is time for her to look at the memory in a way that reduces the negativity. Perhaps she imagines that everyone wet their pants at the same time, and the laughter was directed toward everyone, not just her. Maybe she imagines that instead of urine, she had spilled soda or something else on her lap. She wants to change the context, so it is no longer distressing and instead funny. Over time, the negative emotions will fade away. It may take time and repetition, but over time, the feelings of shame will be desensitized and fade away. Content Reframing Another technique that can be useful toward yourself is learning to reframe the content. You will effectively be taking the feeling that you want to eliminate and reframing what has happened in order to change the result. This is effectively attempting to tap into the cycle of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. For example, if you feel like you are a bad person, you are going to act in ways that fail to show that you are a good person—you will be nervous and flighty. This will lead other people to want to keep their distance, only further reinforcing that initial thought of being a bad person. When you are able to remove that initial negative feeling, so you stop obsessing, you will see a change in behavioral patterns as well. For example, let’s go back to the woman who urinated in class as a child. She is so concerned with embarrassing herself in public again that she gets afraid every time he knows that she has to perform or give a presentation. This leads to nervousness, which leads to a failure to perform to satisfaction, which further reinforces her fear. In reframing, you will effectively stop focusing on the negative and instead shift your attention to something else that will help, such as accepting your own responsibility for your emotions. You may decide that you will no longer worry about failing or making a mistake and instead focus on how to ensure that your project is as successful as possible. In doing so, you will actually shift your attention to something that you can fix. In the end, you will perform better and teach yourself that the shift in attention is absolutely necessary. You will find that life gets better and that you actually are not as afraid of presentations as you initially were because you have begun to get some positive experiences out of it. Anchoring Yourself Finally, the last process that will be discussed within this book is how to anchor yourself. You will be able to use that anchoring process with all of the benefits of anchoring that was discussed earlier and begin to apply it to yourself as well. The only real difference in anchoring yourself versus anchoring others is that when you anchor yourself, much more of the process is internal. You do not have to try to trigger emotions in other people—instead, you are focused on yourself and what you need to do. This will follow the same steps as anchoring other people: You will still be making it a point to identify an emotion, identifying a trigger for the emotion, identifying an anchor, triggering the emotion, and then using the anchor until it works. That stays the same. What changes are the methods through which you are able to anchor other people? Instead of focusing on how to trigger the feelings in other people externally, you must trigger them within yourself. For example, consider our friend who had the accident once more. Perhaps she wants to stop feeling anxious and instead feel relaxed when she is presenting. She declares that the feeling that she wishes to trigger is relaxation. She then must think of a time during which she felt that emotion incredibly strongly in order to use it. Perhaps she chooses a time on her wedding night during which she and her newlywed husband watched the sunset over the ocean to the sound of the waves lapping at the beach. That time was particularly relaxing for her and she loved it. That memory becomes her trigger for her emotion. Now, she chooses a simple anchor—she decides to use a very specific tapping pattern of her toes against the bottom of her shoe, as she knows that it will be discreet, and she will be able to use it in public without anyone ever knowing. She thinks about that memory at the beach, waiting for the feelings of relaxation to wash over her, and right as those emotions reach their peak, she taps her toes within her shoe to the pattern she is linking to the memory. Over the course of several days and attempts at this, she finds that every time she taps her toes, she is reminded of that relaxing memory. She has now anchored herself to that feeling and can use it any time she is in public and feeling distressed, or whenever she has to present for someone at work. She can use these techniques and find that her stress and anxiety simply melt away. Conclusion Congratulations! You have made it to the end of Manipulation and Dark Psychology.

Dark Psychology Secrets Techniques of Dark Psychology to Analyze and Read People's Mind with Persuasion, Hypnosis, Deception, and Brainwashing Introduction Congratulations on purchasing Dark Psychology Secrets and thank you for doing so. Have you ever wondered why some of the most insidious people on the planet are somehow able to charm everyone to fall for their every whim? Think of serial killers like Ted Bundy—he was commonly believed to be a handsome, charismatic young man that was able to quickly and easily win the favor of others almost naturally, and yet behind the scenes, he was a serial rapist and murderer of at least 30 homicides over a 4 year period of time. How did he do it? How was he able to sneak past so many people undetected for so long? The answer is through dark psychology. Many of the darkest personality types out there are quite capable of seeming charming and affable, only to be hiding the monster underneath their masks. This is a method they use to prey on other people, victimizing those who dare to fall for their charm. Dark psychology delves into these personality types, studying the underlying motivations for the behaviors at hand. This is not only to understand what to look out for when you are in the real world—when you learn to understand the minds of those with dark personalities, you can begin to claim their own ways of thinking. Dark psychology is a study of people with these dark personalities, but also a study of the tactics that are used, why they work, and how they can be adapted. You can use several of these tactics without becoming abusive or using them in a harmful way. What if you were able to find ways to come across as charming and persuasive to others, and you used those powers to help yourself and others? Perhaps you, being charismatic and particularly skilled in influence, were able to become a powerful leader within a company—you could use the powers of dark psychology to keep morale up, keep people motivated, and ensure that others are happy and willing to move forward. You would be able to always find the perfect way to convince other people to carry on. You would be able to ensure that everyone under your charge was happy to help. You would find yourself running a particularly successful business. Now, what if you were in sales or politics and convincing people is what you need to do best? Dark psychology can show you the ways that people are able to slip undetected into the mind of another to plant ideas, convince others to see things your way, and move forward. You could use these skills in advertising or consulting. Despite the root in darkness and evil, dark psychology techniques can be particularly useful, even under the most innocent contexts, and this book seeks to show you exactly how they are able to do that. This book will guide you through an overview of dark psychology, allowing you to get to know those dark personality types and how they work. You will learn about manipulation and how to use it to control the minds of others. You will learn to persuade with skill. You will understand the insidiousness of brainwashing and how it can be used to completely indoctrinate a person into a certain belief system. You will discover deception and neuro linguistic processing. You will learn to use hypnosis to coax people into a state of suggestibility. Lastly, you will see the benefits of dark psychology, learning how it can be used in daily relationships in order to help all involved. There are plenty of books on this subject on the market, thanks again for choosing this one! Every effort was made to ensure it is full of as much useful information as possible, please enjoy! Chapter 1: Dark Psychology Psychology at its root is something that is relatively simple to define—it is the scientific study of the mind. It covers several different aspects, looking into relationships, behaviors, thought processes, and more. When you are looking into psychology, you are looking for the why and how of essentially any human process form the mental side. You may be looking at neurobiological processes, such as what happens within the brain when it is actively controlling the body, or you may be looking at why that 5 year old child at the grocery store had a massive meltdown when told no to candy. It studies all of that and more, but essentially, it is the study of who we are as a species and as an individual. It studies what we do, what drives us, and what causes us problems. It explains emotions and how they both function and aid humans in acting. It explains why some people give in to pressure, but others do not. It explains why empathy is so important. Ultimately, psychology exists in several different classifications. Some people are only interested in the physical aspect while others care about development. Others still are interested in the divergences between typical psychological development and the developments of people who may become particularly hard to live with. It has several uses, both practical and simply intellectual—if you understand human psychology, you are able to see and predict how people will behave. Knowing those tendencies, you can accurately figure out what will happen, and learn how to use those tendencies to your own benefit. Defining Dark Psychology Dark psychology, in particular, will look specifically at the psychology of people that have a very specific personality type. In particular, we are looking at those who are Machiavellian, narcissistic, sadistic, and psychopathic. These people tend to be among the most dangerous that you can encounter, and they will have no qualms about using and abusing other people. However, there is much to learn from this personality type—if you can come to understand this personality type and the tactics that are commonly used, you will be able to emulate them without the threat or harm that may otherwise go along with them. In particular, this book will be looking at the behaviors of those with dark personality types. We will spend Chapter 2 looking specifically at the dark side of psychology, studying what those particular personality traits are and how they present themselves. From there, the duration of the book will be spent studying the behavior of those specific personality types. Dark psychology assumes that when people behave in abusive manners, using techniques like manipulation and deception, it almost always has a reason. We will look at those reasons and applications as well, learning what it is that makes these tools so attractive to monsters in human clothing that are willing to wield them. You will see exactly why people behave in ways that are abusive or evil, how they come to the realization that they do that justifies the abuse in their minds, and how they are able to overcome the empathy and compassion that usually prevents people from behaving in such abusive manners. We will look at several of the most commonly used techniques of the abusive personality types, and from there, we will spend time discussing how several of them can be used in a wider context, allowing for their usages during day to day interactions. Instead of manipulating someone to abuse them, you can look into how to use the same skills to help persuade and guide people toward whatever they need to do. We will also look into how these particular tactics impact the person that is being subjected to them. Some of these techniques work through instilling feelings in other people, knowing that emotions are incredibly motivating. Others work through accessing the unconscious mind, suggesting certain behaviors. Others still work through acts of deception. Understanding dark psychology will not only enable you to understand the actions of personality types such as the narcissist, the Machiavellian, and the psychopath but also be able to combat it. You will be able to avoid falling for their tactics if you know what the tactics are. This means that learning to think like the darkest personality types is imperative—when you can think like them, you can identify them. The History of Dark Psychology Traditionally considered a field of applied psychology, dark psychology begins with the study of the dark triad or the study of manipulation. Considering that dark personality types have existed as long as history can record, it comes as no surprise that those interested in understanding these dark types have been scattered across history as well. In particular, it is possible to find evidence of studies surrounding manipulation and abuse in nearly every culture around the world. Humans have always victimized other humans as long as they have been able to. You can read in history books about how people used to take slaves, destroy other towns and villages, and steal. Ultimately, up until relatively recently in history, attempts to manipulate and control other people were common, but not particularly controlled or recorded. It happened on a regular basis, but without proper guidance and logging that allows for it to be tracked. After all, even religious texts make reference to manipulation, such as referencing Eve being deceived by the snake. In proper psychology, there have been studies to determine how stimulations of any kind can change behaviors. These have studied aspects such as whether fear can be conditioned and learned, or whether adding certain situations or wording could convince people to act in certain ways. Perhaps one of the earliest records of controlling the behaviors of others comes in 1897 with Ivan Pavlov’s study of dogs and their behavior. He learned that some of the behavior of dogs seems to be innate, such as salivating in response to food. He also learned that innate behaviors can be linked to other stimuli. Instead of the dog salivating at food, for example, he conditioned the dogs to salivate to the sound of a bell through what was eventually called classical conditioning. In classical conditioning, you are able to take unconditioned responses and cause them with unconditioned stimuli. The food is the unconditioned stimulus, and in response to seeing it, the dog will salivate in response. That unconditioned stimulus gets paired with a conditioned stimulus, and in response over time, you will see that the unconditioned response occurs when exposed to the conditioned stimulus. The concept of classical conditioning was strongly supported by psychologist John Watson, who declared that he believed that classical conditioning was involved in all aspects of human development and psychology. He pushed the point in 1920 in an experiment during which he conditioned a 9 month old infant to fear anything white and fuzzy. In particular, during this experiment, a child referred to as Little Albert was provided access to several white animals in a neutral setting. He was shown a rat, a rabbit, a monkey, and several other items. At first, Little Albert was not afraid of any of them. He was unafraid of what he saw in front of him. Eventually, the white rat was presented, along with the sudden loud bang of a hammer on a steel bar just behind his head. While the rat itself was not disturbing to the child, the sound was, and he cried. From 11 months on, he was exposed to the rat with the loud noise occurring once a week for seven weeks. Of course, the child cried each time. After the seven weeks, all that researchers had to do to trigger the meltdown was to show him the rat in question. Upon seeing the rat, even without the noise, he would cry in fear and attempt to flee. That was not all—Little Albert became phobic of anything that was white and fuzzy. Whether a white dog, a piece of cotton wool or even Santa Claus, the sight of something white and fuzzy was enough to send him into a panic. While this behavioral response faded somewhat over time without reinforcement, it was still readily triggered by repeating the creation of the loud sound that went along with the rat. This becomes a foundation for many different forms of manipulation and influence. You will see this concept arise repeatedly when you look at neuro linguistic programming, during which you will see what is called anchoring, a technique to trigger a certain behavior with a specific emotional response. It can also be relevant in emotional manipulation as well. After the discovery and conceptualization of classical conditioning, the concept of operant conditioning arose as well. Particularly in 1936, B.F Skinner came up with the concept, drawing heavily from Thorndike’s 1898 Law of Effect, which posited that anything with a positive consequence is likely to be repeated, while anything with a negative consequence is going to be avoided. For example, if a child is given a piece of candy after cleaning up his mess, the child is going to be more inclined to pick up the toys in the future, thanks to the positive effect. Conversely, if the child yells at someone and then gets a negative consequence, such as having to go to their room, they are not as likely to repeat it. This concept was reiterated within Skinner’s theory, and he added to it a new concept—reinforcement. Skinner asserted that if a behavior is reinforced, meaning that it is rewarded, it will be repeated or strengthened. The person is likely to repeat those behaviors that are reinforced because they had a good result. However, when reinforcement does not occur, that behavior is going to be weakened or extinguished. In 1948, Skinner reiterated these concepts with experiments. He created what he called a “Skinner Box” which was a box in which an animal had access to a lever, a speaker, and two signal lights. There was also an electrical grid on the bottom that would generate a shock. The animals were shocked when they pressed the lever with a specific light illuminated, but when they used the lever with the other light illuminated, they were rewarded with a piece of food. Through this experiment, it was shown that there are three types of responses that will follow a behavior: Neutral operands, during which the environment neither encourages nor discourages the repetition of behavior, reinforcers, which drive the individual to repeat the behavior and punishers, which discourage the repetition. You will see this concept when looking at techniques such as intermittent reinforcement, during which a manipulator will give positive reinforcement only sometimes. As you can see, much of behaviorism becomes incredibly relevant to the study of dark psychology. The 1960s came with Albert Bandura, another prominent behaviorist, acknowledging and agreeing with classical and operant conditioning while also adding two distinct and important ideas. He asserted that there are processes between the stimuli exposed to and responses and that behavior is a learned concept that develops via observational learning. In particular, Bandura presented an experiment known as the Bobo doll experiment in 1961. He argued that children, in particular, will pay attention to the behaviors or their models—people that they are surrounded by—and they will imitate the behaviors that they were exposed to. Think of how a toddler may yell out something embarrassing in public, not realizing that it is embarrassing because he has heard it from his parents: This is the perfect example. In Bandura’s experiment, he exposed children between the ages of 3 and 6 to violent behaviors toward a doll. First, children were studied to see how aggressive they were as a baseline. They were then sorted into groups of similar temperaments, in which some were shown an aggressive role model, some were shown a non aggressive role model, and some were given no role model. The aggressive role model was aggressive toward a Bobo doll —they were given a hammer to beat the doll with and threw the doll around while yelling, “Pow, boom!” The non aggressive model saw a model ignoring the doll and playing with another toy quietly. The children were then offered access to several other toys, which a researcher told them were the best toys of all. Their behaviors were then recorded. Children who had been exposed to the aggressive behaviors tended to behave aggressively toward the Bobo doll that they had access to. This shows us that children learn behaviors through observation—social behavior is learned and influenced heavily based upon model, becoming the basis for the Social Learning Theory. This is further supported in several of the tactics used in dark psychology as well. People are more readily persuaded by people similar to them, much like how the children are more likely to mimic people similar to them. People are also more likely to mimic others in unfamiliar settings as well, which is displayed in tactics such as persuasion. As you continue to read through this book, you will find that much of the concepts that are innately used by the manipulators that are being studied involve many of the concepts of behaviorism. It becomes recurring, and in a way, it makes sense: Behaviorism is a study of how people act and how the environment influences behavior. Dark psychology seeks to control and change the behaviors of other people. As you continue to read, keep these key processes in mind as they will be quite relevant. Chapter 2: The Dark Side of Personality Imagine Anna for a moment: Young, finishing up her last year at college, and single. She is out with friends at a bar, and her other two friends have both already met people that they are animatedly chatting with. Anna, however, is a bit more self conscious. She does not feel like she belongs there, and she sits between her friends, sipping at her drink. Then, she sees him. The man is handsome and smiling at her. He approaches and offers to buy her a drink. He says his name is Ethan and that he has just graduated from the same university Anna goes to, just last year. He asks a few questions that are not too prying—is she a student? What is she studying? What a coincidence—he also majored in business! Is she from the area? No way— he grew up 30 minutes from her hometown. They seem like normal questions to Anna—he is getting to know her, and it appears that they have several major things in common. She chats with him, and soon, they are talking about her past relationship and how it was incredibly messy, so she isn’t looking for anything at the moment. Instead of scaring him away, he nods sagely and acknowledges that he had been in a relationship with a particularly abusive, narcissistic woman not too long ago and he was just looking for someone to get to know as friends. They spend the rest of the night in the bar chatting happily, and when Anna and her friends are ready to go, he smiles, writes down his phone number for her, and bids them good night. Anna finds herself hooked—she cannot stop thinking about Ethan and how much they had in common. Soon, she is texting him, and she finds out that not only have their lives paralleled quite closely, they share very similar hobbies. They both like to sit in and read with a nice cup of wine. They both like to go on hikes in the nearby mountains. They both share a love for playing video games—but the same type of obscure RPG, not the mainstream titles that come out. Soon, Ethan has slid into Anna’s life entirely. He is over at her apartment 5 or 6 days a week and stays the night at least half of them, usually falling asleep halfway through a movie. He brings her flowers and lavishes her in positive attention. He loves to listen for hours about everything that she has gone through in the last few years and offer his own opinions as someone who had been in a similar relationship before. Anna tells herself that he is the one. He is different. He is kind and caring. He knows how to listen. She soon finds herself head over heels in love with him. They fall hard and fast for each other, and within three months, they are engaged—after all, they are soul mates. Six months later, she is pregnant. Nine months later, they are married. Shortly before the baby is born, it is like a switch has flipped. He is mean and cold. He is constantly disappearing overnight at the bar. He puts her down and when she cries, he calls her hormonal. It was like the Ethan that she knew, loved, and married, was nothing but a lie. This is because he had lied. People with dark personalities have no qualms about preying on other people. Just as the wolf does not think twice about the feelings of deer, the dark personality type does not care about his victims. Ethan had disguised himself precisely because he was hunting Anna: He was intentionally trying to make himself attractive to her—he wanted to be able to interest and attract her in order to gain control. Oftentimes, people with dark personalities, with the propensity to manipulate, hunt, and use other people, present themselves in four different ways: They are Machiavellian, narcissistic, sadistic, or psychopathic. Some people will have several of these traits, while others may have just one. Nevertheless, these people are dangerous. They are not afraid of inflicting extreme mental, and sometimes even physical, harm to other people in order to get what they want or need. All that matters to them is that they get exactly what it is that they needed. People with these dark personality types are known as having dark cores— they are more likely to engage in antisocial behaviors such as behaving malevolently, stealing, cheating, or hurting other people. These are the people engaging in dark psychology, and the more that you read through the book, the more you will come to recognize the methods through which these personality types choose to act. Within this chapter, we will stop and take a look at four of the darkest personality types—we will look at the Machiavellian, the narcissist, the psychopath, and the sadist. We will go over the classical presentation of each of these personality traits, as well as the motivators for each. While each of them is their own distinct type, with very specific traits, they all share similarities. In particular, each of these dark personality types lacks empathy. A Note on Empathy Empathy is the ability to understand and feel other people’s emotions. It is primarily responsible for facilitating communication between people, allowing others access to the emotional states of those around them. In particular, it allows for people to act compassionately—you can put yourself in someone else’s shoes, so to speak. If you can see that the person across from you is stressed out, you can relate. You can feel that sort of stress yourself if you are particularly empathetic. In knowing the emotions of someone else, you can then feel moved to help—you can offer to do something to alleviate that stress. In other instances, empathy allows for the regulation of your own behaviors. If you can empathize with someone else, you can make sure that you, yourself, are not the cause of their distress. Consider for a moment that you are talking to someone and say something that offends them. If you can empathize with them, you can see and understand that you upset them—and you actually care. In being able to acknowledge that you have upset them, you can then make it a point to change your own behaviors. This is why empathy is so critical, and why lacking it can be so dangerous. It is what usually acts as a deterrent to hurting other people needlessly. Machiavellianism The first of the personality traits that will be discussed is Machiavellianism. Machiavellians are people who are highly manipulative by nature—they are able to cheat people out of things without you ever knowing that it has happened. This particular trait is named for Niccolo Machiavelli—a diplomat and philosopher responsible for writing The Prince—a book that discussed that strong rulers must be harsh on their subjects in order to keep their rule. In particular, it is believed that the earning of glory and survival will justify any means. Effectively, then, this is the beginning of the flawed idea that the ends will always justify the means. The people with this personality type, then, encompass that form of thinking. They feel that they can be manipulative with little repercussions, or that the repercussions are meaningless so long as they get their way. The Machiavellian is focused on his or her own ambition—all that matters is success, no matter what the cost. They will always prioritize their own success, regardless of what their idea of success is. If they believe that success is defined by their income, they will maximize that income, no matter the cost, for example. Of course, if they are willing to succeed at any cost, they are typically incredibly exploitative. They will have no issues with taking advantage of other people, their weaknesses, or even throwing people under the bus if they think that it will be enough to get them the success, they believe that they deserve. There is no such thing as going too far with the Machiavellian, so long as the Machiavellian gets his or her way at the end of the day. These people tend to be incredibly calculating. They will constantly be acting in their own best interests, even when people do not think that they are. If they are kind and do a favor, it is because they know that doing that favor is the best way to ensure that the other party is going to give them what they want later. Nothing they do is without reason, and they are not likely to help other people unless they can see some sort of legitimate benefit to doing so. This makes it incredibly difficult to identify their true intentions. The Machiavellian, despite coming across as charming and flattering, is usually incredibly cynical—he does not believe that anyone will ever do anything for reasons that are not self serving. To the Machiavellian, if anyone does something nice to them, it is because they want or need something and think that being ice will get it. In reality, they lack the value of inherent human kindness that they typically take advantage of, and their lack of empathy means that they do not care when they are taking advantage of other people. They will actively and readily harm other people, making other people fall for them without ever really committing to legitimate relationships. However, because they are so skilled at reading those around them and deceiving other people, they are commonly seen as far more charismatic and caring than they actually are. Narcissism The narcissist, on the other and is far less intentional and calculating. While the Machiavellian is incredibly meticulous in his manipulation, narcissists do not make the intentional decision to be manipulative people. They also lack the empathy necessary to regulate their actions regarding how other people see them, but in terms of the motivations, the narcissist is manipulative because the narcissist is delusional. The narcissists are particularly exhausting because they have their own grand sense of self—in fact, it is so grand, that most of the time, it is grandiose. They are completely convinced that they are the best people out there, and entirely perfect. Because they are so confident in their perfection, they effectively believe that they are right all the time. There is no way that they can be wrong because they believe that they cannot be flawed, and this turns into them believing that when there is a disconnect between what they expect to be true versus what is actually true, they tend to assume that their own beliefs are the ones that are right. This gets incredibly exhausting as people deal with them—they believe that they are perfect and inherently deserving of more than those around them. They think that they deserve special treatment and consideration and that treatment and consideration means that they will do anything to get it. Effectively, the narcissist’s manipulation and harm toward others comes out of that expectation of being right all of the time, believing that their grandiosity is justification of everything. However, the problem with the narcissist is that he is so skilled in convincing other people that he is right and deserving of special treatment that he will even gaslight himself into believing it. The narcissist will absolutely believe his narrative of what happens. If he tells someone that something did not happen in a certain way, they have likely convinced themselves of that narrative to protect that image of perfection that they are so certain about. They will always believe that they are deserving of that perfection, no matter what. Narcissists themselves crave the center of attention—while they are unable to empathize with other people, they absolutely believe that they are deserving of the adoration of others, and they require it in order to feel like they are justified. They have a constant need to be admired, and if they are not admired, they will do things to gain that admiration, even if it hurts other people. Psychopathy Of the four traits that we are looking at, psychopaths are quite arguably the worst of the four. These people have the greatest potential to be harmful. When attempting to identify their personality tendencies, the psychopath is someone who flags as highly callous, impulsive, manipulative, and grandiose. Effectively, the psychopath is someone who is not afraid of hurting other people to get what he wants. He is willing to give in to those impulses that would usually be disregarded quickly. If he has the thought that he wants to hurt someone else or toy with someone’s emotions, he will do so as a game, simply because he can. He believes that he is able to do this without regard for the feelings of other people, and he will do it without thinking twice. Like the narcissist, the psychopath thinks incredibly highly of himself—he believes that he is smarter than other people and that he is skilled enough to get away with whatever he wants to do. If he decides that he will become a serial killer, he is convinced that no one will ever be able to catch him—he is entirely of the belief that he is more intelligent, sneakier, and more capable than any of the people who have attempted this manipulation before him. Despite the monstrous nature of the psychopath, they are actually incredibly adept at social situations. Unlike the narcissist, who may struggle in social settings if his grandiosity gets the best of him, the psychopath is even more skilled at blending in. They are able to emulate normal humans with ease and will do so to their own advantage. They see their skill at blending in as a game and they will often try to convince as many people as possible that they are trustworthy in order to take advantage again later. Sadism While the previous three make up the personality types commonly referred to as the dark triad, there is one more trait that is important to consider here when discussing dark psychology—the sadist. The sadist has all of the callousness of the dark triad, but unlike them, they are not particularly impulsive or manipulative. The sadist is someone who is entirely motivated because he enjoys being cruel. The everyday sadist simply wants to hurt people or watch people suffer. He may make it a point to join the military or police force, allowing himself to shield himself from any repercussions. Within those particular career paths, he may feel like he can hurt people or be exposed to harm of others without having to hide it. Of course, if that sadism comes along with one of the other personality types, such as paired with narcissistic personality disorder, it can become incredibly problematic—the sadistic narcissist is one that genuinely enjoys hurting people but may even feel like he has a right to do so. He will be able to justify his actions without having to try very hard simply because he knows that he is better than other people. Dark Personalities and Abuse Ultimately, these personality types lend themselves to abusive individuals due to the increase in callousness when compared to the others. Because of the callousness, none of the people discussed in this chapter have any qualms about their abuse. This means that Ethan, in his relationship with Anna, does not care about the pain that has been inflicted. He does not care that he effectively trapped someone under false pretenses, creating an indelible bond between the two of them forever. Even if she were to leave, she would never be able to truly escape him thanks to the fact that they share a child. Studies have been done on the dark personality types that have shown that these people will tend to choose to act in ways that inflict pain, especially if they are quite sadistic. In this study, people were asked to choose from one of several jobs—the study was disguised in order to make the participants believe that they were looking at personality type and job preference. The jobs were to reflect the type of dark behaviors that they would then be told to do. Some of the jobs were to work in the cold, work in sanitation, or being an exterminator. Unsurprisingly, most of the sadists chose extermination. From there, the scientists created what they called a killing machine—a coffee grinder that was modified in order to make crunching sounds, and they were instructed that they had to kill several bugs in names with cute names in an attempt to humanize them. Throughout the experiment, the sadists absolutely did choose to kill the bugs, and they were not disgusted by it. They were happy to kill the bugs and enjoyed it, though compared to people without sadistic tendencies, they enjoyed anything that they chose to do less than their non sadistic counterparts. After these results, another experiment was performed—during this one, people were sorted based on personality, and then were asked to play a computer game. The people playing the game were told that they were competing in order to blast a loud noise at the people in the other room. If they won, they would be able to choose how long and loud the blast would be. As an important note, the opponents never blasted back. Half of these people would then have to work to be cruel—if they won, they would then need to count before the blast of noise would occur, with the interest of the study being how likely the extra work would deter the people from being aggressive. Ultimately, only the sadists chose to work to hurt the other party. While those with the dark personality types would all inflict some degree of harm to the opponents when it was easy, adding the extra layer of work was enough to deter the other personality types. Beyond just that, the sadists also chose to raise the blast and make it longer just to hurt the other team when they realized that there would be no retaliation. Effectively, then, the sadists are the ones who are more likely to hurt other people. Even the psychopaths, who will hurt or kill without feeling bad about it, usually had purpose to drive them. The Machiavellians were too calculating to risk the harm of other people unless they felt like the payoff was right. The narcissists usually went out of their way to hurt others when they were threatened. However, the sadists would hurt just to enjoy themselves. This means that, at the end of the day, it is the sadists that are going to be the most manipulative. The narcissists will be aggressive and abusive in response to the perception of a threat to themselves or their ego. The psychopath will hurt to gain something or because he wants something. The Machiavellian will abuse only when it seems like the best way to get what he wants, and it will not be risky to do so. Chapter 3: Manipulation Perhaps one of the most common forms of the usage of dark psychology is via the use of manipulation. Ethan manipulated Anna as he made it a point to get to know her, little by little in order to reflect back what he thought she wanted to see. In an act known as narcissistic mirroring, he was able to present himself as exactly what Anna wanted, allowing him to draw her in. She was convinced that he was perfect in every way when in reality, it was all a fagade—he hid behind a very specialized mask in order to win his prize: Anna. Manipulation primarily exists in two forms—it can be covert, meaning that it happens without the manipulated individual knowing about it, or it can be overt and in everyone’s face, such as extortion or blackmail that involves threatening and coercing the other person into obedience with them knowing full well that they must either comply or suffer the consequences. In particular, those within the dark tetrad tend to prefer the covert forms of manipulation—they want to be able to do their jobs well and effectively without worrying about the aftermath. They think that their attempts to manipulate will be more effective if they remain hidden, and for the most part, they are right. When you want to understand manipulation, you must first learn to define manipulation and how it works. When you understand that definition, you can start to understand how it is used in order to be effective. Once you understand the pattern of how manipulation is used, you can begin to recognize several specifically manipulative tactics that are commonly used. In recognizing the common tactics of manipulators, you can begin to recognize the manipulator. Finally, in recognizing the manipulator, you can defend against manipulation. Defining Manipulation Psychological manipulation is ultimately a form of social influence—that means that it is attempting to succeed at one of three different end goals: It will gain compliance, in which the people will agree to do something, even if they do not actually believe it is the right thing to do, it will gain identification, which will change the thoughts of the other person, or it will gain internalization, in which it will cause a change in belief or behavior that is also agreed with publicly and privately. Compliance * Obedience publically, even if individual does not believe in what he or she is doing a * Individualchoosesto do somethingto belike someoneelse | * A change in values and behaviors both publically and privately | Effectively, then, manipulation seeks to change someone’s actions, thoughts, or both to fit with whatever it is that the manipulator is encouraging. In particular, though, manipulation tends to be indirect, deceptive, or underhanded. It is designed specifically to change the thoughts or behavior without the other person being aware of it while also serving the manipulator in some way. Most often, the manipulator has some sort of agenda that is being addressed —that agenda becomes the goal for that manipulation attempt. Ethan wanted to win Anna’s favor, for example—he made it a point to convince her that he was someone he was not because he saw something that he liked within her. A narcissist may manipulate someone because he wants to gain that approval and acknowledgment that he needs if he wants to feel comfortable in his own skin. The sadist may manipulate because he wants to inflict pain. The Machiavellian may manipulate because he wants to be able to achieve an end goal and manipulation is the only way it will happen. In order for manipulation to be successful, no matter what the end goal of it is, three criteria must be met. The aggression must be concealed in some way, usually with the manipulator seeming like someone trustworthy or worthy of respect and consideration. The manipulator must have some working knowledge of any vulnerabilities that will be exploited, understanding how best to move forward to manipulate. Lastly, the manipulator must be ruthless enough to not care about lying and potentially hurting the other person. Think about how this relates back to Ethan for a moment. He came across as perfectly charming in the beginning and Anna never suspected a thing. He got to know her, noticing in particular exactly how she suffered from an abusive relationship in the past, which he used to force a relationship. He took advantage of that bit of knowledge and then encouraged her to continue discussing anything and everything with her, which he then used against her on a regular basis. Any time she told him about something personal, he would remember and use it to continue to build the relationship more and more. Finally, he was willing to hurt her, even though most people would usually hesitate and avoid doing so. Using Manipulation Most of the time, manipulation occurs in very specific manners. In order to manipulate someone, you must be able to meet one of five criteria to use as the motivator. Think back to the discussion of behaviorism, particularly with Skinner and the discussion of positive reinforcement and punishment. This is where these concepts come back, but in terms of manipulating other people to control their behaviors, most of the time, there are five distinct manners of encouraging or discouraging behavior. In artificially installing the desired behaviors with one of these tactics, the desired behaviors become learned relatively simply. Ultimately, it will be a matter of figuring out which the best particular tactic is for that situation. The manipulator has a lot to consider—is the victim someone timid and easily malleable? They may respond best to positive reinforcement or the use of intermittent reinforcement. Are they more hard headed? It may be best to try utilizing a one trial learning in an attempt to condition the desired response. The five distinct manners of controlling the victims of manipulators are through the use of positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, intermittent reinforcement, punishment, and traumatic one trial learning. Each of these are used in different ways to differing effects based on the target and the desired goal. As a quick note before continuing, remember that there is an inherent difference between positive and negative, regarding both reinforcement and punishment. When you are adding something, whether that something is good or bad, you are said to be using positive reinforcement or punishment. When you are removing or taking away something, you are using negative reinforcement or punishment. This varies from the traditional understanding of positive and negative in the more colloquial sense, in which people see good things as positive and bad things as negative. We must step past that misperception to truly be able to understand what is being discussed as we Positive reinforcement Negative reinforcement continue. a5 Intermittent reinforcement Traumatic learning For example, if your child pulled straight A’s on his last report card, you may take him out for ice cream—this is an example of positive reinforcement. If you find that your child has failed three classes, however, you may give him extra chores until he has his grades up. This is an example of positive punishment because you are actively giving him an aversive stimulus in response to his misbehavior. Alternatively, taking away your child’s video game system upon realizing that he is failing his classes would be a form of negative punishment—you are taking away something positive. Finally, if you are removing a negative situation, such as no longer nagging at your child after your child has made it a point to turn in all missing work is an example of negative reinforcement—you removed the aversive stimulus to encourage the behavior you wanted. In general, positive reinforcement is by far the gentlest of the forms of manipulation. It will involve the use of creating or giving feedback to the victim in some way to encourage a behavior. Effectively, when the use of positive reinforcement occurs, the victim is rewarded for doing the desired behavior. Think about how a dog that is listening during training is given a reward—they are given a small treat to encourage the repetition of those desired behaviors. This means that they are more likely to continue with those behaviors in the future thanks to the fact that doing them became enjoyable. Because the desired behavior gets associated with reward, the behavior is more likely to be repeated. Negative reinforcement is more or less the opposite: the behavior increases because something negative was removed. Imagine that you are being nagged at by your boss to finish up that assignment for work—you are only alleviated form that constant nagging when you finish. In that case, you were negatively reinforced simply because the removal of the aversive situation happened. Intermittent reinforcement uses reinforcement that is inconsistent. In particular, it is most likely used in the occasional revocation of a negative reinforcement. For example, imagine that Ethan expects Anna to clean the house top to bottom and it is rarely good enough for him, no matter how hard she tries. When she cleans up, she is occasionally granted with the benefit of having him be pleasant, or at the very least, not as grumpy. Occasionally, he chooses to reward her just enough to keep her hooked, making sure that she does not want to leave. Instead, she fights harder because she sees the occasional hope that the Ethan she fell in love with is still there. Punishment is the usage of the addition of something unpleasant in order to dissuade someone from behaving in a certain way. When you are punishing someone, you are usually causing a negative consequence of some sort as a direct result of a behavior, or a lack of the proper behavior, in order to keep the victim on track. Finally, traumatic one trial learning relates to the use of sudden, harsh abuse that is meant to intimidate and traumatize the victim into no longer repeating those tactics again in the future. Effectively, the victim does something that the manipulator is unhappy about and the manipulator drastically punishes him or her. If Anna were to have done something that Ethan did not like, he may have decided to leave her on the side of the road or threaten to take their shred child in order to strongly discourage her from repeating that behavior. The sole purpose of this behavior is to make the person so traumatized as a result that they will no longer repeat those behaviors. Recognizing the Manipulator Identifying the manipulator is something that can be incredibly difficult to pull off. It is tough to ensure that you can spot when someone else is manipulating but being able to do so is incredibly beneficial. Knowledge is power and power is a proper defense from being taken advantage of needlessly. When you want to recognize and identify the manipulator, you will basically be looking for several different traits and actions. If you want to be able to know if the other party is, in fact, manipulating you, stop and reflect on your relationship. As soon as you know what you are looking for, you will find that they become far more transparent than they ever were before. Manipulators will undermine your ability to trust yourself. One of the most common forms of manipulation is known as gaslighting— they use this to convince you that what you think is happening around you is actually all a figment of your imagination. Even if they have done something in front of you, such as taking the last piece of pizza with you right there, they will then deny it, saying that you must have eaten it. They are so skilled at doing this that you may actually begin to believe them, leaving you questioning your own sanity. Manipulators say something different than what they are doing. Rarely do the words and actions of the manipulator match up. When you are being manipulated, you may find that the manipulator is actively saying one thing but doing the exact opposite. Perhaps Ethan says that he has Anna’s best interest at heart, but nothing he does actually reflects that. Instead, he frequently does things that are arguably not in her best interest. What he may say is to make sure that she does not eat unhealthy food is actually little more than an attempt to keep her under his thumb, making her feel bad and causing her to give in without actively trying to fight back. You regularly feel guilty when around the manipulator, and you can’t explain it. When you are around the manipulator, you may find that guilt becomes a common occurrence. No matter how hard you try to avoid it, you cannot help but feel that sense of guilt, despite your best attempts. You think about things and cannot figure out why you would be guilty, and yet there you are, feeling like you should have tried more, done better, or attempted something entirely different altogether. This is not a fault with you—if you are constantly feeling like you are guilty, it is time to reevaluate to determine whether you are simply surrounded by people who are hurting you or if you have actually been behaving in negative ways. The manipulator is always the victim, and you are usually at fault. The manipulator is particularly skilled at ensuring that you feel like whatever has happened is your fault and that whatever it was is a slight toward the manipulator. Even so much as accidentally forgetting to bring your partner’s requested food home from the store will suddenly be spun around, instead becoming a deliberate attempt to hurt the manipulator. The manipulator pushes the relationship far too quickly. Much of the time, the manipulator will make it a point to move the relationship as quickly as possible. They will share more than they really should in order to convince the other party that they are being truthful about what they are doing. They will intentionally try to convince everyone involved that what they need above all is to move quickly. They will love intensely, push business relationships before proper trust is built, and use their own feigned vulnerability to fool those around them into sharing and making themselves vulnerable as well. The manipulator will happily agree or volunteer to help. But then it always turns into a martyr act. While he may have agreed initially, he will show all sorts of reluctance. If you dare to ask him if he is actually reluctant or points out that you will be fine without him, he is likely to instead deny and make you feel guilty about even suggesting such a thing. Instead, his goal is to make you feel like you are indebted to him for future use. The manipulator will always be one step ahead of you. Whether for better or worse, the manipulator will always be further on the spectrum. If you are having a bad day, the manipulator’s day is automatically worse. If you just got into a great university, the manipulator will be quick to remind you about how he went to a better school. They will always simultaneously have it better and worse than you, no matter what is going on. Defending Against Manipulation No one wants to be on the receiving end of manipulation—the problem arises when so many people are victimized without knowing what the signs of manipulation are. When you do finally learn what they are, however, you are able to begin fighting back You can start to make the progress that you will need in order to reclaim your life and keep the other party from hurting you any further. There are several tactics that you can use to defend against manipulation, ranging from avoiding the manipulator altogether to directly countering what is being said to you. From here, we will go over three methods that you can use to defend yourself from manipulation as it arises in your life. Know Your Basic Rights Perhaps one of the best ways to protect yourself is through learning to recognize your own inherent rights as an individual. As a human, you are entitled to several basic human rights, and more often than not, the abuser tries to get around them. When you recognize and defend your basic human rights, you will be able to stand up for yourself—you tell the other party that you are not willing to put up with such blatant disrespect and abuse. Instead of being willing to lie down flatter and completely disregard the fact that you have been treated poorly, you will be instead of making sure that you demand the treatment you deserve. Some of these basic human rights include: e The right to respectful treatment e The right to be expressive of your own thoughts, feelings, and desires e The right to say no for any reason without guilt e The right to get anything that you have paid for e The right to your own free opinion e The right to ensure that you are safe, physically and mentally e The right to happiness e The right to instate and enforce any boundaries Each of these fundamental rights can strengthen your defense against the manipulator. If you say that you deserve respectful treatment and demand it without exception, you can make it clear that you will tolerate nothing less than the utmost basic respect. You will not deal with name calling, harmful or hurtful behavior, or anything else that may keep you down. If you are cognizant of the fact that you have several thoughts that are your own, and you are entitled to those thoughts, no matter what anyone else thinks, you protect yourself from mental manipulation. When you recognize that you are free, physically and mentally, you can stop allowing the manipulator to hold you back. Effectively, these boundaries become your shields with which you fend off the narcissist or manipulator. With those shields, you protect yourself from damage. However, the battle is not won simply by wielding a shield—you need to be proactively able to protect yourself as well. Protecting yourself is as simple as figuring out the best way to probe back at the manipulator. Probing to Defend from Manipulation Questions such as wondering if the request seems reasonable to the manipulator, asking if it sounds fair, and then wondering if you have a say one way or the other are all ways that you can go out of your way to twist things around and put the onus back upon the manipulator. For example, imagine that Ethan tells Anna to run to the store as soon as possible to pick up a very specific item. She is exhausted and does not want to drive across town, but he is incredibly insistent that she goes. She could stop and ask him if that seems reasonable to him. She may ask, “Are you really expecting that I drop everything after having gotten two hours of sleep, right after baby falls asleep, just to get you that special nacho cheese that I can only get across town?” When she twists things around like that, it suddenly seems far less reasonable for her to have to follow through with doing what the manipulator has requested. This works for a very specific reason—you are now twisting things around and putting the pressure back upon the manipulator. When you are able to redirect to the manipulator, you can effectively change the tactic—instead of you being on the defensive, you are suddenly on the offense. Instead of having to defend yourself, you make the manipulator have to defend against you. Effectively, then, you can point out everything that is wrong with the suggestion. You leave the manipulator with two choices: He can deny that what he is saying is unreasonable, saying that he would absolutely go and do what he is asking you to do, or he will be forced to admit that the requests are too one sided and are incredibly unfair. Saying No and Enforcing It The last method that is quite easy to use in order to disarm the manipulator is to simply learn how to say no and mean it. So often, we make it a point to let other people rule our lives. We are willing to put up with what other people tell us to do and what they say simply because we are too afraid to stand up for ourselves. However, think of the implication there—if you do not stand up for yourself, you are going to find yourself struggling. You will always be pushed around, left and right, expected to do whatever the manipulators that want to take advantage of you determine is right. When you learn how to say no, however, you take away that power. The only power that the bully initially holds over you is the power to rule your life. When you learn to say no and really mean it, you are actively telling people that they cannot control you. You are saying that you do not consent to being taken advantage of, and that is significant. If you can tell other people no, then, you can follow through and avoid falling for the problems that the manipulator wants you to. Manipulators count on what is called the nice guy or nice girl syndrome— they assume that you will say yes simply in the name of being polite, and as soon as they know that they have an in somehow, whether through you, your actions, behaviors, or anything else, they will not hesitate to take advantage of you, over and over again without relenting. The only way to end this is with your own boundaries. This means that when you say no, you need to enforce it. If they continue to try to pester you into something, you are within your rights to simply walk away. You do not have to consent to being controlled, and in fact, you are going to be happier and better off if you refuse to altogether. Saying no does not have to be difficult either—all you need to do is apologize, say that it does not work for you, and move on. There is no reason to explain why it does not work, no matter how hard the other party pushes for a reason—if you relent and give them the reason it does not work, they will try to find a way to disregard what you are saying in order to try to force you into agreeing. Simply responding with, “That doesn’t work for me, sorry,” is the perfectly polite way to shut someone else down without having to provide much information. Remember, an invitation does not mean that you are forced to do something, and a demand is not mandatory unless enforced by the law. When your boundaries are ignored and continuously stomped upon, what you must do is find a way to stand up for yourself. The best way to do so is to keep your distance from the other party. While they may initially accuse you of being manipulative or controlling, keep in mind that all you are doing is choosing to not expose yourself to their ridiculous demands. You are protecting yourself, and you should not feel guilty for doing so. Instead, focus on the fact that you can get that distance that you needed while also making a point to heal. If they try to convince you that you are punishing them, remind yourself that you are simply giving yourself time until you can see them again without being angry, whether that is in the near future or never. You are well within your rights to choose who you associate with, and even if they cry and complain and tell everyone that you are a horrible person, you are truly only responsible for your own feelings and opinion. Chapter 4: Manipulation Techniques to Control Minds At this point, you should have a fairly decent understanding of the concept of manipulation. You should see how it works and be prepared to identify it. However, what can make this situation even easier to identify is learning how to control minds yourself. Remember, the more you learn and the more you are able to understand, the more likely that it is that you can protect yourself. The tactics that are going to be used here are quite dangerous in the wrong hands—for people who have no qualms about hurting other people, these can absolutely be weaponized into dangerous techniques that can truly convince other people to do dangerous, horrible things. However, they can also provide you with valuable insight into the mind of not only the dark personality, but also into the mind of the people that they target. When you look at how to control a mind, understanding the intricacies that go into sneaking into someone’s thoughts, implanting your own, and then escaping without ever raising any red flags, you are learning to really interact with other people. What if you inserted good thoughts that helped people? For the most part, many of the tactics of manipulation are not particularly good for usage outside of controlling people, and the tactics that are being discussed here make particularly potent weapons. While the ones that you find here will largely not be good to use on other people without the intent to completely and utterly control someone else at any cost, you will find more actionable advice in the next few chapters with techniques that are far more target friendly than most of that of manipulation and mind control. Remember, manipulation is a form of influence that is primarily dark. It is primarily designed to be hidden, undetected, and drastic, and that is exactly what you will see here. You will be provided with a guide to the most insidious of the manipulator’s weapons here, from mind control to figuring out how to isolate people. Mind Control with Implanted Ideas Ultimately, mind control is the ability to remove free will—you are effectively systematically entering the mind of someone else in an effort to get them to think or behave in a different manner than they have been. You may be trying to convince someone of something such as to change religions or to join a cult, or you could be simply trying to get your best friend to agree that the band that you want to go see next weekend is actually great, despite the friend hating them. It is important to note before beginning that there is an important distinction between mind control and brainwashing—mind control is far more covert, whereas, in brainwashing, the prisoner or person being brainwashed is aware of it. When someone is using mind control, they are befriending the person, earning a position of trust, and using that trust in order to infiltrate the mind of someone else in order to create a brand new personality type altogether. Effectively, then, this leads to several thoughts implanted in the individual’s mind without the individual knowing where they came from. If done successfully, there should be no way to really discern the thoughts from those that were implanted unnaturally. Mind control starts with the development of a relationship first and foremost. When that relationship is developed, the manipulator is able to get access to the other person’s mind. Of course, this takes time. The manipulator has to wait patiently for the victim to open up and render him or herself vulnerable. However, as soon as that relationship is built up, the manipulator can begin to take advantage. The manipulator can make it a point to engage in talking about topics, dropping just the right amount of hints to begin to infiltrate the mind of the other person. For example, if you really want your friend to like your music, you can spend the time to tell him how great the band is. The next day, subtly mention something about the band. Continue to do this, and after a while of hearing the same idea over and over again, the unconscious mind becomes more impressionable. You may then decide to play the music after a week or two of repeating that they are so great to your friend and find that your friend is super into the music. He may even ask you what the band is because it sounds so great. That is when you can drop it on him that he has been listening to that one particular band that you wanted to go see, and you can ask him to go with you. Using Mind Control 3 Impl Build Lower self mpana SSE Shea thoughts ‘ repetition) Effectively, mind control will come with several steps that you must complete in order to be effective. You must first develop enough of a rapport with the other person to be a trusted individual. This is the part that takes the longest. The more genuine you can make the relationship seem, the more potent your skills will become. This means then that if you want to use this technique, you need to be in it for the long haul. Think about how so many manipulators make it a point to rush through the honeymoon stages at all costs—this is because they desperately want to be in that familiar, trusted position of power with the other party. When they are, they are effectively able to start working on the manipulation side quicker. Since people that are trusting of the manipulator are more susceptible to long term manipulation, this is a preferred method. Upon becoming trusted, you must begin to lower the other person’s self esteem somehow. People with higher self esteem are harder to control just because they are too trusting of themselves. If you want to take out someone’s self esteem, you must lead them to think that they should not trust themselves. You want them to feel like their own thoughts are inaccurate or not true to reality. You may find ways to subtly imply that the other person is not particularly intelligent, skilled, or otherwise capable in an attempt to make them feel like they should not even bother trying. As self esteem lowers, you should have an easier time starting to implant your own thoughts into the mind of the other person. You may want the other person to actively associate a specific emotion with a certain consequence, and you can do that. You can condition the other person at this stage as well, using what is commonly referred to as NLP anchoring, which will be discussed more in Chapter 8. After repetition of the thoughts that you wish to install, you may see them beginning to take hold. Your friend may readily listen to that music that he hated before. The person that you were trying to make more agreeable to have a better shot at dating is beginning to feel more self conscious and therefore far more susceptible to any attention. You may decide to install multiple thoughts or triggers to allow you to better control the other person. No matter the techniques that you chose, one thing is for sure—when you learn how to control the minds of other people, you learn how to take control of who they are. You can implant new interests. You can teach them to be loyal to you. You can convince them that they have always been interested in certain political affiliations. You can change who they are entirely, and they will have no idea how it happens. Effectively, you expose the other person to these changes so slowly over such as a long period of time that they believe that the changes in their thoughts are their own choices. Gaslighting Gaslighting is one of the more dangerous tactics that those with dark personalities employ. After all, what could possibly be more insidious than teaching someone that they cannot rely on who they are as an individual? When you are gaslighting someone, you are effectively teaching someone to doubt their own sanity. Have you ever found yourself in such a moment of self doubt? Have you ever found yourself crippled into inaction because you cannot be sure if things happened the way you believe they happened or if you are overreacting? Maybe you tell yourself you are imagining the way an interaction went, or you think that there is no way possible that things happened the way you think they did. The manipulator wants to latch on to any doubt that you may have and take advantage of it. Over time, the manipulator can effectively make that wound of self doubt fester and grow, slowly consuming your ability to trust yourself and eroding it away into nearly nothing. This process is incredibly dangerous—someone who cannot trust himself is not going to be particularly effective in dealing with other people. Think back to Anna—when she first started seeing signs of Ethan being someone, she thought he wasn’t, she asked him about it. “Why are you so grumpy now?” she may have asked at one point, only to be met with a quizzical look and a quiet response of, “What are you talking about?” Being met with something without aggressiveness, attention, or frustration is enough for Anna to wonder if it was all in her head. Along with those occasional attempts to derail her, he may also move her keys. Never far or hiding them entirely—but he would shift them from the pants she had worn that day to a pair that she had washed earlier in the evening, only to toss that same pair of pants back in the dirty laundry pile. She will go hunting for her keys, only to have Ethan say he thinks they are in the laundry and have her find the pants that she could have sworn she had hung up just hours earlier. He may quietly correct her when she tells a story, reminding her that the detail went a different way than she is reporting it. Did the story actually go that way? Probably not—but he is trying to discredit her in her own mind. That is all gaslighting is—it is a pervasive discrediting of the victim’s own trust in reality. Over time, the idea that Anna internalizes is that she is incapable of actually ever trusting herself. If she is ever asked anything, she is quick to defer to Ethan because she has taught herself that she is untrustworthy. This means that Ethan’s control over her increases as he continues to tighten his grip. In order to use this technique for yourself, you would simply start by discrediting something particularly harmless. You may move keys or check the mail early and pretend that your partner had checked it when they hadn’t. You may make it a point to tell your partner that the oven was left on when it wasn’t and more. Over time, you slowly up the ante. Over time, the stakes of whatever is going on increase more and more. You point out that your partner is driving to the wrong store and that you are going to one on the opposite side of town when your partner turns into the store you had agreed to go to. You may tell your partner that she forgot to pay all of her bills and that you paid them all for her, even though she was up late the night before doing so. Eventually, gaslighting gets so incredibly powerful that the victim could see a car go by and then you could deny that it had ever gone by. The victim would be willing to accept that as the truth simply because she has lost faith in herself. Isolation Another common manipulation tactic is isolation. People are social creatures—we are primarily happier and more fulfilled when we have some sort of interaction and relationships with other people. However, manipulators frequently find themselves feeling threatened by the idea of their victims having inner circles of friends and family members that cannot be controlled. The manipulator wants to retain full control of the victim, and as such, it becomes common to isolate the victim away from everyone else he or she ever knew and loved. It may start out as simple as voicing a displeasure about certain friends or family members. Over time, it may strengthen into something far worse— the individual may find that it is easier to cut off friends than it is to deal with the jealousy or pushback. The manipulator may make up stories about particularly problematic members of the victim’s inner circle, such as declaring that the best friend of the victim has been trash talking the manipulator for the last week, even though the poor manipulator has done nothing wrong. Over time, the victim internalizes all of this—the victim begins to internalize this. If you are constantly told that the only person that could ever love you is a person that has been abusive to you for years, you may begin to believe that. If the manipulator plays his cards right, he becomes the only circle of support for the victim. This is intentional—if only the partner or spouse works, the victim is stuck at home with the children simply due to the prohibitive cost of childcare. If the victim wants to go out, there are always a million reasons why that cannot happen. Ultimately, the end result is the same—little to no support for the victim. Without support, the victim has no one to help. Moving out can be intimidating, or even just impossible depending on the situation. Isolating people is commonly done by making problems between the victim and those around him or her that the manipulator has facilitated. He may make it a point to call out the victim, telling her that she cannot possibly go out with those people because they are too promiscuous. The next time that they are going to a bachelorette party and I was told, “Oh, you know what? I feel really sick, and you’re going to need to take care of the baby.” There is always a reason, and over time, the individual victim loses credibility. Criticism Remember how a basic tenet of being able to control the mind of someone else was being able to damage their self esteem? This is where you begin to do that. You are effectively going to be attempting to damage the other person’s self esteem so much that they do not want to make choices for themselves. The criticism that you shower them in is enough to deter any decision making. When you want to criticize someone else, you need to figure out what their true weaknesses are. If they are commonly threatened by the idea of being a bad parent, you may latch onto that, throwing it in the victim’s face as much as possible. If you are working on a big project for school to get your master’s degree, you may find that your partner is suddenly telling you how dumb or stupid you are and that you will never make it. You may find that actually being able to proceed is next to impossible if you feel strongly and regularly criticized. The more criticized that you feel as well, the more likely that it is that you will fail. You will be distracted and all of your attempts to actually do better will likely suffer as well. When you are too busy or too afraid to take the leap in order to actually be successful. Your distraction will potentially cost you your degree, and that is exactly what the manipulator wants. The manipulator wants you to feel like being successful is an impossibility, because if you believe that it san impossibility, you will not try to leave. That means effectively, you are self sabotaging without ever realizing it, all because of the constant criticism fed to you. Think back to Anna for a moment. Ethan criticized her regularly later in the relationship after having originally gotten Anna in the first place. He chose to behave poorly, telling Anna that she could never get the house clean like he expected, even though he is home all evening without helping. She is constantly asked why she cannot do anything right despite her best efforts, and over time, that critical worldview becomes her own. All that needed to happen was that Anna was repeatedly and ruthlessly exposed to the same manipulative propaganda over and over again reminding her of just how worthless she truly was. Now, was Anna particularly useless? Not at all—she has taken care of her child and also managed to work on school. However, she was not living up to Ethan’s impossible standards and he was not afraid to make her pay for it with his criticisms and sharp words. Fatigue Finally, the last manipulation tactic that we will discuss is fatigue. Have you ever felt so tired that you were convinced that you would drop dead or pass out at any point in time? Perhaps you stayed up extra late working on a project and never got to sleep overnight. Or maybe you had young children that woke up around the clock, indoctrinating you to the lack of sleep club that every young parent is introduced to. No matter the cause, think about how you felt after not getting enough sleep. You probably felt like you were lagging and like you could not think clearly. Despite all of the coffee that you had chugged throughout the day, you could not help but feel like you were ready to collapse soon. You found that you were far more ready to just go along with what your partner was telling you—if he says that you need to run to the store to buy something, you are willing to do so. If he decides that you need to clean up, you begrudgingly get up and do it in your half asleep state. The reason that this happens is that over time, as you become more and more exhausted, your mind’s own mechanisms of being able to fight such influences begin to wane. It cannot defend itself if it is too exhausted to function, effectively. Instead, those safety mechanisms, or at least, the primary ones within your mind, malfunction. Instead of being able to fight back, you find that you simply agree because it is easier. You do not see the battle as being worth the little effort, so you agree. Fatigue is a commonly used tactic afros the board. It has been used to torture people into spilling information before. The studies of the brain have shown that as soon as you have been kept up for just 20 hours, you are already just as impaired as if you had drunk a beer or two instead. You need to be able to rest to keep your mind sharp so you can protect your body. When you are sleep deprived, then, you are susceptible to all sorts of dangerous and insidious abuse. All you have to do to make someone sleep deprived is actively prevent them from sleeping as long as you can. Try to find techniques that can be brushed off as being some sort of coincidence rather than intentional. You may turn on a light and then apologize and say you thought the other person was sleeping. Dose the other person with caffeine. Convince the other person to stay up late with you for some reason—perhaps you will be watching a movie together or something. Ultimately, no matter the method that you choose, you will find that you are able to gain covert control over the mind of others if you were to utilize the tactics within a relationship or with someone else. You can weaken the mind’s defenses. You can slip past them entirely undetected. You can convince people to believe false realities and more. The power of mind control is very real, but please remember that it is a dangerous ability that should not be taken lightly. Chapter 5: The Power of Persuasion Persuasion is incredibly powerful. When you can persuade someone to do something, you can usually get them to agree with whatever it is that you want them to do. If you want to get someone to go on a date with you, you can persuade them to do so. If you want someone to hire them, you want to be able to convince them that you deserve to be hired in the first place. If you want someone to help you, you want to persuade them. Persuasion occurs in nearly every aspect of life. It will be a prevalent aspect of nearly every interaction that you have with other people. So much as just suggesting to someone that you would like to go somewhere is a form of persuasion—it is the attempt to socially influence. This means that you are trying to get someone else to do something else, changing their behaviors in some way. When you can persuade someone else to do something, you have changed their behavior in a way that did not involve coercion or forcing them somehow. You effectively managed to convince them in a way that showed them exactly why you are right. Now, whether the method that you used was emotional versus being a legitimate attempt to logically convince someone else is up for debate, depending upon whether you feel that emotions are a valid justification method to use to convince someone else. As you read this far, you may have questions: What specifically is persuasion when referring to it in a psychological manner? How can you truly be persuasive? Why does it matter? Are there specific methods that usually or always work? Why do they work? It is normal to have these questions going through your mind. After all, if you now know that you can persuade people to do nearly anything, you may be wondering exactly how that persuasion can happen, and possibly even whether it is happening to you. The good news is that persuasion, specifically compared to manipulation, honors free will. This means that any attempts to persuade you are not necessarily coercive or threatening in any way. Instead, they will place a particular emphasis on truly wanting the other person to arrive at the solution on their own. That is what makes persuasion so effective—it is guiding the other person to make a decision. What is Persuasion? By definition, persuasion is an attempt to change either attitudes or behavior without duress. The persuasion usually comes in some sort of communication. Keep in mind that many different aspects interfere with behavior and attitude, which is why you can have some influential techniques such as brainwashing or mind control, but then also have persuasion. All are different forms of influence, and they all work in different manners. Keep in mind that not all communication is persuasive: In fact, you usually communicate for one of three reasons. These reasons are to persuade, to inform, or to entertain. Sometimes, you can sort of blur the lines between the two, such as using the information to persuade or persuading someone through humor to make the other person like you more. However, persuasion is its own distinct form of communication that should be treated as such. Consider for a moment that you want to convince your spouse to agree to take your annual vacation to Hawaii this year. You may be entirely determined to go to Hawaii, but you know that your partner prefers to go places that are far cooler. Keeping that in mind, you offer up all of the reasons that you would like to go. You inform your partner that you would like to get the sunlight to boost your vitamin D. You tell your partner that you have always wanted to go to Hawaii, or that you know that it is beautiful at that point in time. Your spouse eventually relents, though you know that your spouse is not going to be particularly happy on the trip. Is this a form of manipulation or persuasion? The answer is persuasion—there were no threats. There were no attempts to hide information. You were entirely forthcoming with everything, including what you were trying to do. Manipulation usually involves some sort of deception and covertness that you did not use when talking about Hawaii. You were not dropping constant subtle messages in hopes of subliminally communicating with your partner—you simply had an adult conversation with your partner about why you wanted to go to Hawaii, and your spouse loves you enough to agree, even if that means sacrificing what your spouse wants to do the most. This is normal persuasion and shows a normal sort of give and take in a relationship. The normalcy of this persuasion would be further emphasized if, the next time you are going on vacation, you consider what your partner wants over what you want yourself. Persuasion, then, becomes a valuable tool in many different contexts. It is critical in attempts to communicate with other people in order to get what you wanted or needed. It is beneficial when you are actively attempting to convince other people what you would like to do. It helps you lead people toward decisions that you believe will be helpful to them, such as if you are a leader that needs to be able to manage the abilities and actions of other people. When you are going to be persuading other people, you are going to be helping them make decisions, and this makes it powerful in advertising in particular. In fact, persuasion is so readily recognized that the study of it links back to the Middle Ages: Rhetoric, which you will be discussing shortly, was commonly used and taught in the university, and was taught to anyone who sought to become educated. Now, without further ado, let us look at two of the most common sets of persuasive techniques that you can find when you are trying to learn how to convince other people of nearly anything at all: the principles of persuasion and the art of rhetoric. Principles of Persuasion The principles of persuasion are commonly used, and you may even find that you actively use them without ever being aware of it. These are six common techniques that can be used in order to directly or subtly guide the thoughts of someone else in order to ensure that their thoughts align with what you want to push. This is not manipulative—it is taking advantage of psychology in ways that can be persuasive and convincing to nearly anyone. If the other person naturally makes the decision that they are inclined to make after hearing the persuasion, that is not an act of coercion and should be treated accordingly. When you are looking at the principles of persuasion, you are looking at six distinct techniques that can be used to persuade. These are social proof, reciprocity, commitment and consistency, authority, scarcity, and liking something or someone. These techniques can be incredibly convincing if you know how to use them effectively. At this point, it is time to delve into each of these techniques. You will be guided through what the technique is as well as how to use it, with a short example for each of the six. Reciprocity Cammitment and consistency Social proof of pg Authority Scarcity Authority Stop and consider for a moment: You have just gotten to your family’s holiday gettogether. You brought with you your favorite mayonnaise based food, but in the rush and business of the kitchen, you realized that your dish got left out on the counter. You got to the meal at noon, and you realized that the food was still out at 5:30 when it was time to eat. Your great aunt is telling you that the food is safe, and everyone will be fine if they eat it. Your brother, who is a professional chef, on the other hand, insists that it be thrown out because it not only sat out in a hot kitchen for 5.5 hours, but also however long it took you to get from your home to the potluck. Who do you believe? Naturally, you are going to lean toward believing the chef, who works with food on a daily basis and is up to date on the most current food safety rules. You are going to be inclined to believe the individual who has had to pass classes on food safety simply because you trust him more on matters like this. Have you ever stopped to consider why you would? The answer is simple: You view him on an authority when it comes to food. This is only natural—after all, he is a chef. In general, people tend to believe the people that they believe to be authority figures. While your great aunt may have been an authority figure in your life at some point, you also recognize that she has a tendency to hoard and has a hard time throwing away any consumable, even if the use by date has come and gone. Effectively, you do not trust her to be an authority on food. This is one of the simplest uses of the principles of persuasion: if you want to be persuasive, you need to make sure that you are an authority in some way. People are naturally more inclined to agree with an authority over someone who they do not see as particularly knowledgeable. This is natural —we tend to defer to people that we believe know what they are doing. This is exactly why we take the advice of doctors, lawyers, and mechanics around the world: We trust that they know what we do not, and most of the time, this is true. ae eet | — Scarcity Imagine that, at that holiday dinner, you all realize that someone has lost one of the pies that were brought for dessert. When dessert rolls around, you all realize that there is not enough pie to go around, even if you were to cut pieces into small amounts. Everyone would, at best, get a sliver of pie without much on their plate because of the lack of the pies that should have been present. Of course, now everyone is vying for one of the pieces of pie. They are suddenly deemed to be far more valuable than they otherwise would have been perceived for one reason: They are scarce. Not everyone can get a piece of pie, or at least, not everyone can get a piece of pie that would be satisfying, and because of that, everyone finds that that the pie must be far more desirable than it otherwise would have been viewed to be. This is the principle of scarcity. When something is in low demand, it is suddenly deemed to be far more valuable. While pie may not be a very high ticket item to use as an example, the point still stands: The less is there, the more it is wanted. Consider instead that you are a car salesperson. You need to be able to sell this car in order to get a bonus the following month, which is where you make most of your money. Now, imagine that the person that you are talking to does not seem convinced. They seem to feel like making a higher down payment is in their best interest, which it is, practically speaking. However, you really need to land that sale, so you offer a deal. You tell the person buying that if they are willing to buy the car that night, that they will get a steal of a deal—the deal that you are offering, however, expires that night and they need to make a decision sooner rather than later. The added pressure pushes the buyer over the edge from debating it to agreeing to do so for one reason: That deal was made scarce. People are risk aversive. They are far more likely to agree to something with a guaranteed payout than risk not having such a good deal in the future. The act of being able to save money now guaranteed seems far more convincing than potentially saving more money in the long run if they were to wait to have a larger down payment on their car, and they will use that logic to guide their decision. When you want to appeal to scarcity, then, you want to make sure that you make the other person feel like they need to make a decision sooner rather than later. They will usually err on the conservative side and take advantage of the deal presented to them. Social Proof Do you remember how in childhood, you were often told not to do something just because your friends were doing it? It turns out there is a good reason for that suggestion—people are far more likely to make a decision to follow the lead of other people if they do not know what to expect or what to do. In an unfamiliar environment or when under stress, people are more likely to follow the lead of those that they can relate to in some way. This means that if you need to convince or persuade someone to do something, you want to make sure that their peers are available to show them what to do, effectively. Think about the holiday gatherings that you attended as a child: Did you typically copy what the slightly older kids were doing? Did you pick up on their behaviors? People learn through exposure, and that is what makes it so powerful. Think about toddlers who will copy the swear words of their parent, or the preteen who picks up smoking just because their peers are, even if they are not particularly interested in doing so. It is not weakness that makes us do these things, but rather the tendency of people to naturally learn from those around them. Imagine that you are still selling cars. You discover that people are far more likely to agree to something if you tell them that their peers also often agree to buy that one particular car for some reason. If it is a young family, you may point out that many people with young children really like the features such as being able to swing their feet under the license plate to open the trunk, or being able to start their car remotely when they are inside, finishing up the final preparations before leaving, all because it makes life so much more convenient when you are already toting a couple of tiny humans that inherently make everything about travel more difficult. After all, when you are traveling with toddlers, you must consider whether everyone has gone to the bathroom, if they are wearing clothing that is safe in their car seat, whether you have their snacks and toys, as well as a change of clothes present and so much more. You emphasize all of this, and you find that your sales pitches become far more effective in the long run, all because you make it clear that other parents also like cars with those features. Liking Another common usage of persuasion is through the principle of liking someone or something. We naturally tend to be persuaded more by those that we enjoy simply because if we are going to be going through the effort to help someone else, we are going to do it because we genuinely want to help. This means then that if you want to convince someone to help you do something, or to obey what you are suggesting, you want to make yourself likable to you. Making someone like you can happen almost instantly in several fashions. You can make yourself quickly liked through simply making it a point to mirror someone, similar to a technique common to NLP. You can also go through the process of intentionally making someone like you through a three step process. This three step process is quite simple: You must make yourself relatable somehow, you must offer a compliment, and you must make yourself seem like team. This works for several reasons—when you are relatable, you are automatically seen as more human than you were just a moment ago. Consider just how many people you interact with on a regular basis: How many of them are you able to actively remember? Can you remember who helped you at the grocery store, or who you passed by at work? Unless you have some sort of super memory, chances are, you do not remember. However, if you can make yourself relatable somehow, you will be more memorable and more persuasive. Because you see so many people throughout the day, you tend to forget that they are people and not just blurs that you pass. In changing that, you automatically want to give them more Compliment the other Beateam person attention. When you compliment the other person, you make a specific association between yourself and the other person: That you are a source of good feelings. This does begin to toe the line into emotional manipulation for some people—it is intentionally triggering the feelings of very specific feelings for a very specific purpose, and for that reason, you should at least make sure that whatever compliment you offer, it is a legitimate one that you meant. If you did not mean the compliment and only said it to get them to like you, you are likely to do the exact opposite: instead of being seen as likable, you will be seen as manipulative, and poorly so. Finally, you want to establish that you and the other person are a team. In doing so, you trigger that camaraderie that is necessary for successful persuasion. When they feel like you are on the same team, they are far less likely to try to guard against you simply because they do not see you as a threat. Because of this, you then become far more capable of persuasion. Their minds will be more open and accepting because they do not think that you will try to take advantage of them. Now, go back to that example of selling something to someone. Imagine that your next client walks in with a young child in tow. You settle down at your dest to talk to the other person, and in doing so, you offer the child a bucket of toys that you keep in a drawer for just that occasion—you know that children get antsy when stuck at a desk for longer than about 2.5 seconds. You smile as you offer the toys and comment offhandedly that you have a child about that age at home too and that it is always tough to get through appointments, so you have made it a point to have your own toys present just in case. You have now naturally offered a tidbit about yourself, and that has made you more relatable. Next, you wait a bit. After a little while of working, you make a comment about how the child is incredibly well behaved and that the client has done a great job with them. This makes the client feel good and they will be happy. Finally, you point out that you are happy to help them, or you tell them to help you help them. This establishes that teamwork that you need in order to convince them to do what you need. Consistency and Commitment The next principle of persuasion is consistency and commitment—people are usually inclined to remain consistent to their commitments for one reason: Being consistent makes you reliable. People want to be viewed as reliable because being reliable is powerful—it is valued greatly and if you can make people see you as reliable, they will continue to go back to you. If you are a reliable salesperson, for example, other people will repeatedly go back to you to make their purchases because they trust you. If you reliably pay back your loans, your credit goes up and people are more likely to give you loans in the future as well. Because people want to be reliable, they will usually follow the same pattern of answering and offering to help over and over again. For example, if you ask your best friend to babysit your kids one night for the weekend and they agree, you may find that they are more likely to continue to babysit your kids regularly every weekend because they have already agreed to do so once, and they want to continue to agree in order to be seen as consistent. They will then continue to babysit when asked because they do not see it as a strain or as a problem. Eventually, however, it seems less like occasional childcare and more like it is happening daily and must continue. That friend is going to likely continue to babysit without a complaint until it becomes a problem because they want to be consistent. All you need to do to take advantage of this principle is get someone to agree with you on one point before asking for something else. A common tactic for this is to ask someone for a pen to get them into a mindset of saying yes instead of no, and they are more likely to continue to say yes in the future. Reciprocity Finally, the last principle of persuasion is reciprocity. To understand this principle, imagine how you feel obligated to offer someone else something in return after they have given you something. If someone offers to help you, you try to reciprocate in some way. For example, if your friend gives you a birthday present, you feel like you are inclined to offer them a present in return on their birthday as well. This works for a very specific reason: People are inherently hardwired to want to return the acts of altruism for them. Did your friend giving you something or helping you actually benefit them in any way other than to make them happy? Chances are, it did not, but them giving to you in the first place can be enough to get you to continue to give to them in the future. Effectively, they guarantee that you will make it a point to provide for them if they were to need it because they have given to you. When you want to use the art of reciprocation, think not what they can do for you, but rather what you can do for them. Ask what they need you to do before you go making demands and you may be surprised to see the result. Rhetoric Another line of thoughts surrounding the art of persuasion is rhetoric. This is literally the art of being persuasive in the first place, and if you can master this, you will be able to use these tools in general conversation. These techniques have been passed down since the middle ages, and if they have continued to be relevant, then they must be useful, at least in some Capacity or another. Ultimately, rhetoric has several requirements. You must be able to control language and know the culture within which you are working. Further, you must understand the rhetorical situation, which will determine what you are trying to do, your audience, the topic, how you will speak, and context. This all combines together to create the rhetoric that you will be discussing. The purpose for your situation will be acknowledging why you are writing or talking. What are you trying to do? Then, you must figure out what you are discussing—the topic. This should determine what you are trying to inform or persuade about. You should be broad enough to be able to work with this, while also being narrow enough that you have a very specific purpose in doing so. Next, you must look into the audience—the person that you are addressing. You may find that this is the hardest to work with, as you will not be able to fully control the audience. You cannot possibly get everyone to do what you want on a whim, and because of that, you need to do your best to work with the audience that you have rather than the one you want. Finally, you have the writer: This is the person doing the persuasion. What are you bringing to the table? Why are you discussing what you are discussing? How is it relevant to you? With the situation identified, you are free to begin addressing the three appeals of rhetoric: Logos, Ethos, and Pathos. Logos Logis is an appeal to logic. At its simplest, it is figuring out how to convince your audience that there is no other option but to agree with you on what you are saying. Oftentimes, this takes advantage of statistics or other facts in order to get the point across. You want to make an argument that is so strong, the audience feels no choice but to agree with it. For example, imagine that you are trying to persuade someone to buy that car you were really pushing for. At this point, you begin talking about all of the statistics that mean that the car that you are discussing is safer. You may pull up crash ratings, or how statistically they save more on gas than compared to other cars. You are trying to bombard the other person with so much information that it is undeniable—the best option available is to buy the car, regardless of personal opinion. Ethos Ethos is an appeal to character. Unlike an appeal to logic, you are trying to make yourself sound persuasive and trustworthy. In advertisement, consider the fact that people tend to use celebrities in order to win people over. If you see your favorite celebrity, who you personally admire, drinking a certain type of coffee or wearing a certain kind of shoe, you are going to feel more inclined to do the same simply because you want to identify with that celebrity. You may also do this to show that you are trustworthy on a science— perhaps you make it clear that you have spent your entire life focusing on that one particular study that you have finally accomplished. Emphasizing that trustworthiness is a great way to make sure that other people will be willing to listen to you as you talk. Think of this as using an appeal to authority—you are listing out anything about yourself that will make you seem trustworthy and worthy of being Pathos Finally, the last of the appeals of rhetoric is Pathos: An appeal to emotion. When you are using an appeal to emotion, you are using emotion to drive the individual forward. You want to make an emotional connection of some way to actually get the audience to feel what you want them to feel.! When you are able to claim and use their emotions, you will find that you are able to convince them to do something. This is for one specific reason: your emotions are meant to be motivating. When you can use the emotions of other people, you can compel them to do a lot. For example, if you are needing to get people to donate to your cause, you mention some of the people that your cause will be helping. Perhaps you tell success stories of people that have been helped by your foundation. When you do this, people feel moved to act. When you want to use pathos, you want to make sure that you identify the emotional response that you want to take advantage of, and then you figure out how best to trigger that emotional response in the other party. Doing so can usually get the other person to do what you are aiming for. Think of how commercials for charities will use photos of starving children and puppies and kittens that look miserable. This is because these pictures are sadness evoking—they will trigger the individual to feel sad, and in feeling sad, they can call for those donations that they want to see. Chapter 6: Brainwashing Have you ever wondered why brainwashing got so popular in media? You may see it in cartoons or as the plot point to an incredibly popular movie or book for adults. It seems like it is commonly used as a device to scare those that are consuming the media, as a sort of creepy, grotesque attempt to make them feel compelled to keep reading while also being terrified. While the concept of brainwashing is nowhere near as grotesque as it can become in entertainment, sometimes involving serums, spells being cast, possession, or other such tactics, it is still a very real occurrence in psychology. In particular, brainwashing is commonly seen in situations such as cults and prisoners of war. This is not the kind of sudden triggering of perfect obedience that it may seem to be in media, but rather something brutal and traumatizing. As you read through this chapter, keep in mind that brainwashing is not something that should be treated lightly. This is one of the most insidious methods of control over someone else simply due to the harm that it can trigger. If you are attempting to brainwash someone, you must remember that the only ways that can utilize this technique are largely abusive and sometimes illegal. If you choose to utilize these methods, you are acknowledging that you are taking that risk for yourself. It is strongly recommended that you avoid these techniques but understanding how it works is still something that is important. What is Brainwashing? Brainwashing itself has a definition of creating new beliefs within someone else that are typically radically different from the original ones. These techniques almost always involve the use of coercion. If you were to simplify this definition, you would say that it is the act of forcing people to comply and internalize a new internal belief system through coercion. The entire purpose of this technique is entirely to force people to change. It involves the act of attacking someone else’s identity so thoroughly that you are eventually able to systematically erase or repress it. This almost always requires some level of traumatic abuse and guilt over an extended period of time in order to truly get it to work. This is precisely why you should avoid ever using this against other people—you would effectively be intentionally and maliciously destroying a person’s very being in order to create your own identity for that person. That is so incredibly harmful, and you should make it a point to ensure that it does not happen. + S S Why Brainwash? Brainwashing happens for several reasons. People will use the art of brainwashing in order to indoctrinate people into cults. Typically, these dark cults demand complete and utter obedience, and if you cannot gain absolute control over someone, you are usually going to have a hard time getting people to stick around long enough to actually actively be abused in any way. In particular, one of the most well known abusive cults that had brainwashed and completely indoctrinated the members was the cult of Jim Jones—he convinced his entire cult to drink cyanide and kill themselves and their children. Other times, it is commonly used during war—when militaries take prisoners of war, they may intentionally brainwash them in an attempt to get the people to break down and obey under any and all situations. For example, during the 1950s, the Chinese made it a point to subject several American soldiers to their processes of brainwashing before sending them back to the US. The people then completely denounced their own cultures and personalities, touting the importance and benefits of the world in China. Even more often, you can see brainwashing in cultures such as North Korea, through propaganda and attempts to keep everyone involved compliant and willing to obey. When these people are subjected to constant abuse with constant feedback about how their leader is the best leader and that they must be perfectly obedient, they develop those beliefs as their Own. What is important to note here is that these brainwashing attempts are not hidden—the people involved will be entirely aware of what is happening to them. However, what is unique is the fact that they still comply anyway. By and large, when people do know that they are being coerced or manipulated, they are usually able to distance themselves from it. This is not the case with brainwashing—the new identity is typically taken simply because the individual wants to stop some sort of egregious abuse that is happening that is too painful or too much to bear. Rather than continuing to suffer, the individual instead makes it a point to give in, allowing for the creation of the new personality simply for survival. This however also adds one extra facet—you can reverse brainwashing, though the guilt will remain. Prisoners exposed to this sort of abuse do eventually revert back to more or less who they were before—they may be terrified of their identity at first, but over time, they become more and more willing to accept who they are as an individual and renounce that old personality created in brainwashing. Steps to Brainwashing Despite the fact that the art of brainwashing is so incredibly insidious, if you are able to take advantage of this process, you will find that it is far easier than it seems. It does not take much to entirely break down a person’s mind, so long as you have no qualms about utterly decimating the personality of someone else. If you are not afraid of destroying someone else, you will find that with just a handful of steps, that person can be destroyed and brainwashed. Of course, that does not mean that it is a quick process—it does take a significant amount of time to truly dismantle the mind of someone else. You will need to have the time, space, and blatant disregard for the law and other human life to take advantage of this Assault on ra s TARO eal Guilt Self betrayal identity technique. Leniency Breaking point Final confession Brainwashing is impossible if the individual that is being brainwashed is Assault on Identity not willing to let go of who they are as a person. This means that the first stage of brainwashing is convincing them that they should not like the person that they are. In particular, you will spend time assaulting their identity in hopes of convincing them that their identity is problematic in some way. Effectively, you want to make them fear who they are and everything they value. For example, you may ask someone what their name is. If they answer with their name, you punish them severely and tell them that their name is something else. For example, imagine that the person’s name is Bill. He tells you that, and in response, you brutally beat him across the back with a board and then tell him that his name is Larry now. Every time that you ask him about his past, his identity, or anything else close to him and he answer truthfully, you would then beat him in order to make him fear the truth. You are effectively teaching him to fear the act of being honest with other people about who he is and because he does fear it, he is not likely to continue to repeat the mistake over and over. Guilt Next, it is time to instill guilt. As the other person is constantly being penalized for who they are, they effectively must be convinced that the abuse is their own fault. Maybe it was a fault of their culture or their family, or it was simply them as a person. You want them to effectively feel like they are responsible for their beatings and imprisonment, and you will get this through repetition. You will add more onto their plate as well—you may blame them for the fact that it is not sunny that day, or that something unrelated to him has happened. You want to lay on as much guilt as possible so the individual rejects themselves in favor of being able to reject the guilt. Self Betrayal Soon, the guilt will build up, as will the fear of torture if they continue to stand by who they are, and the individuals being brainwashed will find that it is easier to simply betray their identities than it is to stay true to themselves. They decide that they would rather break away from who they are as people in order to protect their lives, as they have reached a point of knowing that death will arrive if they are not careful. They would rather betray themselves, satisfying the fact that they need to survive, and they obey and submit. Breaking Point Upon denouncement of who they were as a person, the people being brainwashed find that they have hit their breaking point—they feel like they have lost all hope. They have accepted their new life and know that fighting back is futile. This is the beginning of the adoption of the new life that has been presented to them, as at that point, to the one being brainwashed, the choices are to assimilate or die, and they have already rejected who they once were. They officially give up at this stage and recognize that they will have no choice but to accept the new thoughts or cultures if they wish to survive. Leniency Next comes a ray of hope—someone that has been torturing the person being brainwashed to the brink of death, when he feels like he cannot possibly cope any longer, offers some sort of leniency. It may be a bit extra food, or a cigarette, or even just a kind word. It is then that hope is dangled in front of the individual and is seen as a legitimate option. The individual will latch onto that trust, seeing it as proof that they can, in fact, survive, if they play their cards right, and they latch onto that. The manipulator has officially won the trust of the one being brainwashed, and they begin to accept that all of the pain of torture will go away as soon as they are willing to give in and comply entirely. Compulsion to Confess At this point, the guilt becomes too unbearable for the individual—he feels like he cannot hold it in any longer and he feels that the only option is confession. He is driven to let go of that previous life and let’s go of it all. The manipulator, of course, encourages this, and soon, confessions are flying for anything possible. Even things that are not the fault of the brainwashed are confessed for in order to let go of all of that guilt. Progress and Harmony After that initial confession, the individual is slowly taught and assimilated. This stage is the education of the new identity and culture. People are encouraged to let go of the past. They agree to go along with what they are being taught out of fear of being returned to the past, in which they are treated poorly. Instead, they are given many basic human decencies to encourage them to continue to make their positive progress in their life. Final Confession Eventually comes the final confession—this is the stage at which they finally give up who they are for real. They are willing to renounce it all, seeing the beauty in what they have been taught and finding that they identify with the culture that has taken them in. They are willing to continue to coexist in this new social bubble and are willing to get in as soon as possible. Rebirth Finally comes the rebirth—at this stage, the prisoners are released. They are no longer being manipulated, simply because they already have been. Instead, they are indoctrinated and welcomed into the new society. While they are usually eager to get involved with the new life and the new people, they may be met with hesitation as people still see them as betrayers and foreigners. There is no amount of naming and ceremony, after all, that would allow the general population in that new circle to accept that they are the new person. Despite all of the effort that went into brainwashing, the general public still wishes to keep their distance, leaving the brainwashed remaining just as isolated as before. Chapter 7: Deception Have you ever felt the pressing need to lie to someone? Perhaps you felt like someone in your inner circle was actively lying to you, but you lacked the evidence that you needed to prove it beyond that sneaking suspicion that whatever was being said was a lie. No matter how certain you were, no one believed you and you were brushed off as being too sensitive or paranoid. What if you could develop the ability to identify the signs of that deception so you could call it out in the moment? Any time that you had those gut feelings that something was wrong, you would be able to point out exactly what it was that caused it. You would be able to tell exactly when you were lied to, in order to point out to yourself that you were not, in fact, crazy. You can end the constant self gaslighting and instead work to eliminate the deceivers that are hiding behind their masks, presenting you with one thing while actually intending something entirely different. What if you wanted to be deceptive? Sometimes, there is a good reason to be, even if it is not always the most ethical option. Sometimes, it is a good thing to convince someone else of something that is untrue, such as if you want to surprise someone for their birthday. If you want to surprise them, you can make it a point to know exactly how to skirt around the truth to keep that surprise under wraps until the big day. Keep in mind that while this chapter discusses deception in depth, it should never be used nefariously. It is incredibly unethical to be lying about what is happening or why it is occurring, and the information provided here is for informative purposes only in order to aid in the identification of lying. There is no condoning of deception. Defining Deception Deception itself is a form of distorting the truth in some way. The truth is often dramatized, avoided, or simply lied about to convince the other person of what is being said, and in doing so, some sort of lie or deception is used to disguise it. It can range from deliberately avoiding answering the question or distracting from the question at hand, such as answering a question with another question, and then answering that question. It could be deliberately misconstruing the truth somehow, such as reporting causation as correlation despite not having the evidence to support that claim. It could even be simply saying something that is patently untrue. What is true, however, is that deception is wrong. It can even be illegal in several instances, such as in false advertising. If you are deceiving others, you are putting not only yourself, but also other people, at risk. Despite the unethicality of deception as a general rule, it is used in several different contexts on a regular basis. It is regularly used in order to win favor, such as in politics, for example. In particular, in politics, politicians will regularly use ambiguity to avoid truly answering the question at hand when they know that the answer to the question will be condemning in some way, shape, or form. Sometimes, people lie for abusive purposes. People like the narcissist will lie about who they are as a person in order to win favor from their targets with ease. They will pretend to be someone that they are not solely because they know that it will help them in the long run. If they pretend to be someone else, they are certain that they will actually attract the person in, and they can continue to lie about who they are. They effectively create a mask to wear to help themselves become the person that they need to be. Other times, people use deception to hide something, such as making sure that their partners do not find out that they are cheating on them. Ultimately, people will lie if they think that it will benefit them. Despite the fact that so many people are so willing to lie, it does not come as naturally as one may think. Lying actually puts a huge strain on the individual at hand. When you lie, your body is unhappy— it naturally releases stress hormones, and it changes how body language is presented. This means that if you are able to read those changes in behavior and state of mind, you can start to figure out whether someone is lying or not at a glance. Types of Deception Deception comes in several forms, depending upon how the individual needs to lie in the first place and what the truth that is being hidden is. Ultimately, people will use whatever method works best for them, but at the end of the day, there are several different forms that deception can take. These forms are important to understand in order to both recognize the deception as it happens, and also how to use deception as well. As you read through the next several sections, keep in mind that you can use these techniques yourself if you are truly certain that you would like to make use of the deceptive powers that are shown to you. Lying Perhaps the most well known form of deception is lying. When someone thinks of someone else deceiving them, it is usually some sort of lie meant to mislead someone. This is also the most blatant destruction of the truth. It is the creation of a new sort of truth altogether—when you lie to someone, you are creating a new narrative with a new truth that may or may not even resemble the truth by the time it is spoken. When you are lying, you are literally making something new up that is unrelated to the truth. It is as simple as coming up with something new to tell the other person. For example, imagine that you really want to go hang out with your best friend who happens to be someone your partner is very insecure about. You may tell your partner that you are going to the movies with a completely different friend altogether to have an excuse to get out of the house during the period of time that you will be with the friend that you know your partner would be upset about. You have told a blatant lie in order to avoid the fight that you know would otherwise arise. Equivocation Equivocation occurs when you make your answers vague intentionally. You are intentionally hoping that the other person will be so thrown off track by the answers that you give that the truth will be ignored. This is commonly used in politics in particular, in which the politician may answer an entirely different question with wording that is just ambiguous enough to sort of give the impression of giving the most favorable answer possible without ever committing to that one particular answer. It is secretive in an entirely different manner when compared to lying. For example, imagine that you tell your partner that you are going out for the night. Your partner then, naturally, asks you where you are going. You say that you are going to watch a movie with a friend and leave it at that as you walk ou the door. Your partner may think that you meant going to the movie theater with someone, when in reality, you are going to that one person’s house that makes your partner self conscious and nervous. You will still put on a movie at some point, so you are not lying, as you went to watch a movie with a friend, but you were not forthcoming with pertinent information that likely would have raised red flags for your partner. Omission Omission is the act of deliberately leaving out pertinent information that should have been included in the original statement. It is designed to hope that the individual does not press on that one particular issue in the hopes that the person will instead focus on what was said instead of wondering what went unsaid altogether. Omissions are dangerous because not every person is going to think to probe every line of questioning that needs to happen. Most people will simply take things at face value, and that is exactly what this person is hoping will happen. When information is taken at face value, the end result is the deception going entirely unchallenged, meaning that it was successful. Of course, it is always possible that the other person will probe, meaning you would need to segue into another form of deception as well. For example, the example for equivocation still counts for omission as well. Not only is the information that was offered ambiguous, it was also incomplete, leaving a massive hole to fill in. This is what makes it a lie by omission—the left out information would have been pertinent to making a properly informed decision at the end of the day. Overstatements Sometimes, people use overstatements in ways that are intended to be comical—they are tongue in cheek attempts to make fun of oneself and are used specifically for fun. For example, someone may say that they were dying after that long workout. Were they really dying? Nope—they added it for dramatic flair, despite the fact that it is untrue. However, sometimes, the overstatement is used in ways that are meant to be deceptive. Typically, these deceptions are meant to play the victim or martyr—the individual makes it sound like they did far more than was asked of them and far more than was intended, and after that, they felt the need to go out of their way to prove all of the ways that they did way more than they needed to. As they talk about how exhausted they were, or how much it interfered with their schedule, they are over exaggerating to look like the victim or the martyr that is deserving of favor. Understatements As a perfect opposite to overstatement comes the understatement. Just like how overstatements can be used comically, so too can understatements. However, sometimes, people will use the understatement to deceive others as well. Typically, this is involving the amount that someone had to do with something, such as someone not wanting to take credit for throwing a birthday party at the office, or they want to make something seem like less of a big deal than it actually was. For example, imagine that you accidentally backed into a light pole when you were driving—there is a massive dent in the middle of your back bumper, and your partner is furious. You may understate the damage, saying that it is fine and that your insurance will just cover the cost of the items so you may as well just not bother fixing it. Detecting Deception Now, with all those forms of deception above, you may be wondering how you can ever be certain of whether or when someone else is lying to you. Luckily, there are some simple steps that you can follow in order to figure it out. In general, you are going to want to practice analysis—discovering what is going on in the other person’s mind through learning to recognize all sorts of nonverbal cues. In learning those nonverbal cues, you will find that understanding and learning what other people are thinking is actually far easier than it may otherwise seem. Keep in mind that this process does involve a steep learning curve, and if you want to become a master at identifying attempts at deception, you will want to take the time to learn more about analyzing behavior. In doing so, you will have a massive amount of information to compare to in order to figure out the truth. Before you begin to identify whether someone is lying, you must figure out what their base, honest behavior is. This is because people’s body language will vary from person to person based on mood, temperament, and environment, so you need to have a solid baseline to compare it to. For example, people who are on the timid side may show that they are nervous, but most of the time it is literally just nerves rather than any true reason to be nervous, such as being deceptive. With the baseline figured out, it is time to look for behavior that deviates from that baseline as you talk. If you can pick up deviations and they fit the bill for common behavioral clusters of people that are deceptive, you may be on to something and you should absolutely spend the time looking into things. If you do not recognize any lying behaviors, you may be better off just rejecting the attempts to identify what is going on after all. In general, there are several important cues to remember as nonverbal cues to deception, such as: e Answering questions that were unasked e Answering questions with questions e Not correcting oneself during conversation out of fear of instilling doubt e Faking a lack of memory e A report of what did not happen rather than a focus on what did e Figuring out some way to justify what has happened, even when not necessary e Have some sort of exact alibi for exactly what they could not explain otherwise. e Use less words than others e Describe actions weakly and passively e Focused on the weaknesses in others Chapter 8: NLP Mind Control Have you ever interacted with someone before and found that, inexplicably, you were beginning to have strange and powerful temptations about what to do next? Perhaps you felt like you needed to do something that you would ordinarily never bother with, or you find that your emotions seem to be strangely all over the place, despite the fact that you should have been able to manage them well enough. There may be an explanation for this: Neuro Linguistic processing. This is a particularly powerful set of actions. Words, and behaviors in order to trigger other people into obedience. Effectively, you will be able to access and interact with the other person’s mind, quietly and subtly controlling their mind in ways that were likely entirely unexpected. NLP practitioners vary from people genuinely interested in helping someone else in the world out to people with no other intention but to manipulate and harm others. In particular, these techniques are incredibly difficult to identify, and in not being able to figure them out, you may find that more and more of your behavior changes over time. For that reason, it is incredibly critical that you develop the ability to understand exactly what NLP is and how it works. Not only will you be able to wield these tools yourself if you so choose, you will also be able to identify ways that the usage of these behaviors can be beneficial to everyone What is Neuro Linguistic Processing? Ultimately, NLP is the ability to learn how to communicate effectively with the unconscious mind of either yourself or of others. When you can access the unconscious mind of someone else, you are effectively learning to bypass all of the checks and balances in place to ensure that they are able to retain free will. In particular, you are learning to become a translator between the conscious and unconscious minds. The conscious and unconscious mind both really struggle to interact meaningfully with each other—one wants one thing, but the other cannot quite understand the request. In the end, wires seem to get crossed, and no one is happy with what has happened, how it happened, or what ends up being the end result. However, with NLP, you can learn to speak that language of the unconscious mind. NLP looks to identify the ways that you can do just that in order to make sure that the unconscious mind is actively communicated with in ways that are meaningful and important. This means that you will be able to ensure that the conscious and unconscious mind are working in tandem with each other. This is important because, as is commonly said in NLP, the conscious mind works out the actions and what is wanted while the unconscious mind is tasked with ensuring that the goals and actions actually happen. Stop and think about what the unconscious mind does for a moment—it is responsible for taking care of any and all automatic actions throughout the day. You do not think about driving—your unconscious mind does it for you. You do not think about how to brush your teeth—your unconscious does that too. Basically, your unconscious mind goes through all of the motions, making sure that you are doing exactly what you need to get through your day with the least amount of effort possible. It wants to reserve valuable conscious mind real estate for issues that are actually important, such as making an important decision on which job to apply for or how to go about achieving that difficult goal that you have planned out. Because there is only so much that can be fit into the conscious mind, the unconscious takes over for you. It allows you to run on autopilot for all of those tedious actions that you must get through during the course of your day. Without the unconscious mind, you would find that you need to decide and consciously focus on brushing your teeth, buckling up, and more. NLP to Control Minds If the unconscious mind is what takes care of all of your automatic, habitual behaviors, then, you may wonder why that is what NLP seeks to target. This is a great question—and there is a very simple answer. The unconscious mind is responsible for emotions. Emotions are unconscious reactions to the world around you. You do not choose to feel happiness or anger; it just happens. However, emotions are incredibly motivating. Your thoughts that underlie everything influence those emotions. Your emotions then influence your behaviors. If you want to control behaviors, you want to be able to alter emotions, and it just so happens to be that the easiest way to alter emotions is through figuring out how to directly tap into the thoughts of someone else. Thoughts When you tap into the unconscious mind, then, you are able to mess around with that sequence. You can figure out how to create new thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, all because you are bypassing the conscious mind and interacting with the unconscious. Since the unconscious will almost never actually be acknowledged by the conscious in the moment, this is the best way to directly and simply interact with the other person to avoid raising red flags. When you use NLP, you are using a process that has been used for years primarily in a therapeutic sense. Despite the popularity of it in recent years when used in tandem with dark psychology and attempts to control people, it was initially designed to be something that could be used regularly to ensure that people were taken care of and healthy. It was meant to give power back to the people, looking at what makes psychologists so qualified to help other people when regular people are not. Effectively, NLP techniques are ways to grant the powers of a psychologist to normal people with little training. These techniques can then be used in ways that will benefit everyone involved—you will be able to actively help other people with ease. You will be able to alleviate doubt, create anchors to instill confidence, and more, all because you have these skills. Of course, there is still the possibility of using this mind control for more nefarious reasons. Just as simply as you could use these techniques in order to help other people, you can use them specifically to hurt others as well. Instead of alleviating anxiety or traumatic memories, you can make associations with fear and avoidance in order to push someone further under your thumb. Effectively, when you learn how to use NLP, you hold the mind of someone else, their entire being, in the palm of your hand, and you will be able to manipulate it at will. NLP and Mirroring Ultimately, before you can do anything with NLP, you must become a well liked individual. You must be able to develop what is known as rapport with the person that you are attempting to influence, as without that rapport, you have no entrance into the other person’s unconscious. Your rapport with someone is effectively an accurate measure of just how likely you are to be persuasive with that individual. If you want to be able to impact the other person’s mind, you need to be able to access it, and the best way to access it is to lower the other person’s guard. Before understanding how to create that rapport, however, consider that the unconscious mind is always watching. Even if your conscious mind cannot possibly process everything that you are being exposed to, your unconscious mind is still able to pick up on things. It recognizes even subliminal signals, such as those included in advertisement that completely subvert conscious understanding—and that subversion is what makes this process so powerful. When you can subvert someone else’s mind, you can take control of it. Mirroring is just one way of creating that rapport and gaining access. When you mirror someone, you are telling them something specific—that they matter to you and that you feel some sort of connection to them. Mirroring is what people naturally do as they grow to know those around them better. Look at two best friends for a few minutes and you will see it—they will both walk the same, talk the same, take drinks nearly in tandem with each other, and more. They do this all for a simple reason: Their unconscious minds have developed that rapport with each other. They are directly communicating with the unconscious mind of the other person, saying that they do like and appreciate that other person, and that the other person has their utmost trust. While developing a natural relationship will always be the best way to create rapport, you do not always have time for that. In those instances, you can create rapport with three simple steps: Create a connection, match the other person, and then identify their punctuator. Creating that initial connection is not particularly difficult—you will want to make good, convincing eye contact, spend the time to listen to the other person, and will the connection into existence. You effectively want to give the other person your utmost, undivided attention in hopes of them realizing that you do enjoy what they are talking about. During this stage, try giving the occasional triple nod. This is when you nod three times in a row, usually pensively, to communicate three things to the other person’s unconscious mind. You will tell them that you are attentive, understanding, and agreeing with the other person. With that initial connection created, you will then make it a point to copy the other person. In particular, you may find that the best way to do this is through copying their vocal cues. While body language is always an easy target to mimic, you also risk raising red flags simply because you are mimicking them, and people generally do not appreciate when someone else is copying them. Instead, concentrate on their verbal cues. When you do this, you will usually start by matching the speaking speed and intensity of the other person. If they want to speak to you animatedly, return that right back to them. If they are speaking to you calmly and quietly, you should do the same. In doing so, you are letting them know that you are on the same page as them, even if the behaviors do not necessarily line up quite right. Nevertheless, it is important. With the verbal cues mimicked, try figuring out what the other person’s punctuator is. The punctuator is something that all people do in emphasis when they are talking. Some people may have a saying that they use immediately after making the point that they want to emphasize while other people may intentionally raise their eyebrows or make a movement of the hand. What is true either way is that the punctuator is something that the other person will have, and if you can identify it, you can use it. Once it is identified, you should make it a point to actively use it. The next time that you think the other person is likely to use the punctuator, mimic it. In mimicking it, you will tell the other person’s unconscious mind that you are someone that can be related to, and thus, you open up their mind. Of course, you will want to test that connection before moving forward— you want to ensure that the connection made is valid before you go attempting to use NLP in other ways. All you need to do is move a certain way to determine if the other person will move like you do. If they do, you were successful. If not, then you have likely run into some sort of snag and they are not going to be as likely to follow along. NLP to Create Anchors After creating that rapport, one of the simplest NLP techniques that you can use when interacting with someone else is to create anchors. Anchors are effectively a form of conditioning that can be wielded in order to control the behaviors of someone else. Think about how Pavlov’s dogs were taught to respond to the bell with salivating even if food is not around—that is exactly what you are doing when you anchor someone, except you are most likely using a technique that is far less humiliating. When you want to start out, you must have a rapport built with the other party. With that rapport built, you will want to ensure that you can actively interact with the other person regularly. Since you will effectively be conditioning the other person, you need to be able to do it with the freedom to trigger and expose the other person. Anchoring effectively requires you to follow a few simple steps: You will need to figure out what the anchoring feeling that you want to use is. Then you must identify a way for you to trigger that feeling. From there, you must choose your anchor. With the anchor determined, you will need to trigger the feeling with the chosen trigger, and then simultaneously use the anchor at the same time. Over time of having the feeling and anchor coincide together on a regular basis, the other person will, eventually, become anchored—that is to say, the anchor will trigger the feeling that you wanted to pair with it. ED E> ED ED ED This process is actually far simpler than it sounds. For example, imagine that you want to anchor your friend that has anxiety. He is always stressing out about finals when he has them coming up, and as a college student, those finals come up regularly. This means that he has no choice but to face that fear regularly. You decide that you would rather figure out how to alleviate that anxiety with something relatively simple. You decide that you want to teach him to feel relaxed when he is exposed to the scratching sound of a pencil. After all, during a final, he is likely to hear the constant scratching of pencils on paper. Now, you have chosen a feeling and an anchor. What you missed, however, was the trigger for that feeling. Perhaps you remember that your friend is always super relaxed when he is listening to music. Something about it soothes his soul, he always says. You then play the music as you are sitting next to him and begin scratching away at some paper. You may actually be writing, doodling, or literally just scribbling in circles, but the end result is him beginning to relax as he listens to the music. You repeat this process over time, making sure that it happens regularly as you want to ensure that you really install that conditioning well. After a few weeks, you find that just scribbling on your paper does, in fact, help him calm down, which then enables you to trigger that calmness at will. He never realizes what you did, but right around the next final, he tells you that he is feeling strangely confident as he goes in—that he feels like he is well prepared because as he had studied and took notes, he found himself incredibly calm instead of freaking out like he normally is. NLP and Pace and Lead Similar to being able to anchor someone, another technique you can use after being able to mirror and set up that valuable rapport with someone else is the ability to pace and lead. When you can pace and lead, you are effectively able to control the emotional state of someone else with two simple steps: You first match what they are doing, and then you change the tempo or intensity of it. Remember, mirroring is usually a mutual occurrence—when you are mirroring someone else, they are far more likely to mirror you as well, and you need to remember to use that concept to your own advantage. When you are mirroring someone else, then, and you can see them mirroring you, you can begin to tap into their body language with your own. This means that you can gently and quietly guide them into doing something else without them ever actively thinking about it. For example, imagine that you are talking to that same nervous friend. This time, he is terrified because he wants to ask someone else on a date, but he is too afraid to do it. He is nervously tapping his fingers against the table and shifting back and forth, clear signs of his current anxiety. Instead of leaving him to it without attempting to help, however, you stop and begin to tap your finger on your hand subtly as you listen. You do not make it a point to make it obvious, but you allow it to happen at the same pace as your friend’s. After a bit, you slowly begin to slow down the speed that you are tapping, and you shift your own body language to being relaxed and open. You may slow down your own breathing in an attempt to impact his own breathing rate. After a while, you notice that his tapping is slowing down with yours. This means that your technique is working, and eventually, when you stop tapping your own fingers, you will see that he does, too. Chapter 9: Hypnosis Finally, we have reached hypnosis—of the techniques for mind control that you are learning, this will be the last. As you work toward the ability to hypnotize people, keep in mind everything else that you have learned thus far. The minds of other people are absolutely sacred and should be treated as such. If you are going to be influencing other people, you should always make sure to do it ethically. Remember, just because hypnotizing someone for your own selfish gain is dangerous and not recommended does not mean that hypnosis itself is bad. In fact, hypnosis has gained massive traction lately. You see it used during labor, with women self hypnotizing themselves in order to avoid the pain of labor, focusing through the contractions as a way to manage their own comfort. You see people using hypnosis for cessation of cigarettes or other unhealthy habits. You even see people using it to help them become more self confident. Ultimately, hypnosis has no shortage of usage or of people willing to try it. If you remember to keep your control of other people ethical and consensual, there is no harm in using these methods. However, you must always emphasize consent above all. Nevertheless, it is time to delve into the mysterious world of hypnosis. Within this chapter, you will learn about how hypnosis works, understanding that it is not the utmost control over other people that is typically depicted in cartoons or movies—instead, it is a state of extreme relaxation and suggestibility. We will go over a few positive uses of hypnosis, such as in labor and delivery, and finally, we will look over the steps on how to hypnotize someone else that is willing to be your subject. If all goes well, you will find that influencing other people is far easier than you may have thought. How Hypnosis Works Primarily, hypnosis works because it is cooperative—usually, one person is willingly being relaxed into a hypnotic state, and the hypnotist then encourages the thoughts and behaviors that are desired. In a therapeutic situation, this may look like encouraging the individual to no longer care about an ex that left or being able to resist those cravings of sugar and to exercise more. Effectively, it allows for the implantation of thoughts in a consensual way. This means that the hypnotist is just the coach—they are there to guide the way through the subconscious to create the results that the individual that is being hypnotized wanted in the first place. The hypnotist effectively is able to manage to walk the individual through the steps of hypnosis, and in doing so, guides the individual to that state of extreme calmness. Within the hypnotic state, it is often reported that the one being hypnotized is convinced that they are asleep. They are so deeply relaxed that they feel like they are entirely unaware of the world around them. However, that could not be further from the truth—when you are in a hypnotic state, you are actually incredibly aware and focused—but only on what the hypnotist is saying. If the hypnotist is guiding you through breathing practices to keep you calm, all you will focus on is what the hypnotist is saying. If the hypnotist happens to be using any sort of prop or focal object, you will focus on that. In being so incredibly focused on one particular moment or instance, you will find that you are able to be readily and easily influenced. This primarily works because of the divide between the conscious and unconscious minds. While the two minds work together, the conscious mind acts like a sort of filter between what the unconscious mind is being exposed to and the mind itself. This means that the conscious is basically the guard dog of the mind, and if it interferes, you are not going to be able to get through to the more susceptible, impressionable unconscious, which is where suggestions are meant to go. When you encourage the conscious mind to focus entirely on one object or action, whether breathing or the swinging of a pendulum, or anything else, you distract the conscious. Think of what happens if you throw a dog a piece of steak: They run after the steak and happily munch on that while you are free to move forward. Effectively, with hypnosis, you throw your conscious mind a steak by having it so incredibly focused on what is going on. As this happens, the hypnotist then makes several suggestions. They will talk to the one being hypnotized, making sure that the unconscious mind is able to absorb and internalize all of those thoughts nicely in order to ensure that they do, in fact, become utilized and acted upon. Because the unconscious mind is going to be the one driving actions without the conscious paying attention, those behaviors become quite easy. They simply happen because the unconscious mind does it. Remember how in NLP, you are actively recognizing that the unconscious mind is the one that controls everything? That is effectively what you are seeing here. Hypnosis, like NLP, will make sure that the unconscious mind is acting accordingly to ensure that the one being hypnotized is able to do what was desired. Why Use Hypnosis? Now, with that in mind, you may be wondering why people are so willing and ready to use hypnosis on themselves to the point that they would even pay other people to help them with the process in the first place. The answer is that hypnosis is incredibly powerful because the unconscious is incredibly powerful. It should be used precisely because it does allow people to tap into their unconscious minds to unlock all of the potential that they needed to utilize. When you use hypnosis, you effectively are making sure that you can draw all of the benefits that your mind has to offer. It offers you benefits such as helping cope with any phobias or anxiety triggers that you may have. If your anxiety and phobia is rooted in your unconscious, what better way to treat it than to directly impact it? It can help with pain management without requiring medication, making it incredibly valuable for people that will need pain medication but may find that they are at an increased risk for addiction or abusing that medication if they have it. It can be used to fight stress as well, working as a sort of grounding method for the individual using it if they want to reach a state of relaxation. It can also be used in more insidious ways—some people use hypnosis to control other people. It is commonly used in brainwashing in cults, for example, relying on the constant repetition of words or other methods that are designed to tap into the unconscious mind in some way, shape, or form. This means that hypnosis can be dangerous for those who are particularly susceptible to its effects. Not everyone is, but the vast majority of people are quite susceptible, and this means that these people could be subtly and unknowingly controlled by strangers without ever realizing that it was happening in the first place. Using Hypnosis Ultimately, hypnosis happens in several different ways—some people utilize an utter bombardment of the senses in order to trigger that unconscious state, while others will lull people into it with gentle storytelling or guided meditations. Nevertheless, regardless of the method, the end result is the same: The other person ends up being controlled without being aware of it. We will stop and look at two simple methods of hypnosis that can be used to trigger trances, which can then be utilized to ensure that the one being hypnotized is entirely obedient. Bombardment Think of a time when you had a teacher or someone else that was extraordinarily boring when they spoke. It didn’t matter what was being discussed—their voice was simply so boring; you could not help but space out when they talked. Though unintentional, that is exactly what this sort of hypnosis accomplishes. When you use bombardment, you are effectively creating a constant and steady stimulation that drones on to lull the other person into a trance. It could involve someone speaking rapidly in a flat voice or using someone’s naturally unvaried voice in order to eventually bore the person into a trance. The brain struggles with processing the information when it is all constant and unending, which is exactly why it becomes so difficult to understand. If you want to use this, then, you will want to start up a single topic and stick to it for the next several minutes, making your voice as flat as possible. You want to talk as much as possible during that time, not relenting at all, even when you see that the other person is beginning to lose focus. As the focus is lost, you can begin to talk directly to the unconscious mind, making suggestions and encouraging certain behaviors. Nonverbal Hypnosis Another method is quite similar but is done in complete silence. However, this one will require you to have rapport built with the individual that you are attempting to hypnotize, as you are going to need to tap into their tendency to mirror you if you want to be effective. When you use this method, you are going to make sure that they are following along with your own body language, and you will start to do something repetitive and rhythmic that is still subtle, expecting the other person to follow suit. When you use this, you are effectively having the same relaxing effect that you have on an infant that calms down when swayed. Just as the newborn calms down to the motion, so too do adults, even though they may not even realize that they are still susceptible to actions like that. Start by ensuring that you do have rapport with the other person. With that established, you want to actively mirror the other person for a while until you know that they are mirroring you back. From there, you will begin to use several motions back and forth in an attempt to sway the other person into a relaxed state. However, the key here is making sure that whatever you do, you are making it subtle and easily followed without it seeming to stand out at all when done around other people. Perhaps you start by tilting your head back and forth ever so slightly. It does not have to be particularly obvious—just gently and subtly move your head in a rhythmic manner. Chances are, so long as you are subtle enough, the other person will never notice that you are doing it—but they will pick up on it themselves. As you do this, begin to use more of your body as well, but make sure it is still just as subtle. Perhaps you slowly raise and lower your shoulders ever so slightly along with the slight roll of your head. Then, perhaps you also make it a point to rock back and forth on your heels as well. You may also alter your breathing as well in an attempt to ensure that the other person is breathing deeply and calmly. With some time and effort, you will find that the other person is following all of your cues, especially if you are a trusted party in the first place. As they begin to relax, you will find that they are far more susceptible to what you are saying, and you are more likely to be able to get them to internalize information in this state than before. Make sure that you tell them everything that you wanted their unconscious mind to know before you stop the hypnotic motions, otherwise you risk them coming out of the trance too early, mitigating everything that you are doing. Chapter 10: The Benefits of Dark Psychology At last, we arrive at the end of the book, and as we arrive here, it seems fitting to stop with a brief address of reasons that you could use dark psychology in ways that are not nearly as insidious as many that were discussed within the book. Remember, while dark psychology may be based upon looking at how the dark personality types prey on people, that is not all that it is good for—it is incredibly important to understand these abilities and skills. In understanding comes the ability to protect and prevent, after all. Nevertheless, as you have been exposed to several malicious usages from several of these techniques, let’s go over the ethics of dark psychology, as well as the benefits that may arise from it. Dark psychology does not have to be the harmful concept that it has become because of the people that wielded it—you can reclaim it. Is Dark Psychology Evil? For the million dollar question: Is dark psychology evil? The short answer is, no. It is actually neutral. It does not have the capability of being good or evil in the same sense that gravity cannot be good or evil—it simply is. As a force without free will, without any way to control itself, it cannot possibly be labeled with a human construct such as good or evil. However, that does not mean that it is necessarily safe, nor does it mean that it cannot be used in hurtful manners. While dark psychology itself is not evil, it can be used by evil people. Just as it is not about the gun being evil, but rather the one wielding the gun that determines how evil the situation is, dark psychology is entirely at the mercy of those wielding it. If the individual who uses these techniques uses it for evil purposes, taking advantage of these techniques to steal and abuse, that is his own failure, and no one else’s. That failure is something that he will have to address for himself and no one else, and that is significant. Of course, that means that the inverse is true as well—it cannot truly be a good force either. While dark psychology may not truly be good, it can be used in ways that are beneficial to people, and throughout the book, you were exposed to several. Is it really bad to influence someone to buy a car that will truly better serve their own family? Is it bad to influence someone to no longer have crippling anxiety at the idea of taking a final exam? What about in hypnotizing someone to no longer have insomnia? You would be hard pressed to find anyone who would claim that any of those were bad decisions or wrong, even though they all used techniques common to dark psychology. Remember, as dark psychology has been studied, people have gained access into the minds of predators that are capable of far more than the average person is. The average person is not going to be intentionally manipulating and harassing people on the regular—he is going to be minding his own business. He does not have any interest in preying on other people. So, would that average person have a use for dark psychology? Quite possibly! It can be used in ways that were discussed throughout this book, and those can be beneficial to literally anyone that interacts with other people. Several other techniques can be used on yourself as well. You can anchor yourself to create your own coping mechanisms, for example, or you can choose to self hypnotize in order to help yourself build self confidence. These are not evil. Ultimately, whether the art is good or evil, one thing remains true—it is all about how it is used that determines how welcome the use of it is. Reasons to Use Dark Psychology There are several reasons that one may intentionally learn dark psychology. They may want to use these methods to help themselves—perhaps they were a victim of a dark personality type in the past and they want to understand why. That insight is invaluable, and gaining the reasons why and how someone was able to entirely and utterly dismantle someone’s personality can be therapeutic in some way. In understanding how you have become vulnerable, you can remove those vulnerabilities to figure out how best to fight them off. Some people may learn about dark psychology out of sheer curiosity—we are fascinated by what scares us. After all, horror is a massive genre in movies for a reason! You may find that learning how the insides of an evil individual’s mind works is just as fascinating as it is terrifying, and for that reason alone, you want to keep reading on how they do what they do. Other people may read simply because they want to be able to fight back. When you can recognize dark psychology, you can prevent it from being effective. So much of dark psychology is all about being able to identify vulnerabilities and exploit them, and if you know those vulnerabilities and about the common exploits, you can simply side step them. You can avoid falling for them and instead work on strengthening your own skills to protect yourself. Effectively, dark psychology is incredibly flexible, as are the techniques. The very same techniques that can utterly destroy someone else can also be used in ways that actually better everyone involved. They can build self confidence and self esteem. They can help cope with anxiety and other mental health issues. They can make you more likely to be successful in interacting with other people simply because you will have a better understanding. Above all, you will be able to protect yourself with ease. You will be able to have peace of mind, thanks to learning about dark psychology. At the very least, you will be able to rest easy knowing that the dark personality types will be far less likely to pull a fast one over you simply because you know what to expect. The Insight of Dark Psychology Now, as this book finally comes to an end, try to think about the ways that dark psychology and the secrets that it holds may have provided you with insight. What have you learned about the world that you did not know before? What do you know about the mind and how it works? What secrets have you learned that are invaluable? Dark psychology is quite unique in the sense that it opens the window for us to see through the eyes of the narcissist, the Machiavellian, or the psychopath. In understanding how these techniques work, you can see exactly what spurs these people to act in the ways that they do. You can figure out why people want to behave these ways and what they stand to gain by doing so. While you may never want to manipulate others yourself, you may find that the insight of understanding why is critical, especially if you are in the position of healing from a relationship with one such person. When you are able to understand the other person’s mind, you may be able to recognize it for what it truly is—disordered. Beyond just that, though, the insight provided in understanding dark psychology allows us to see what made us so vulnerable to its grasp in the first place. You will be able to see exactly why these problems arise. You will know what it is that each of these techniques plays off of, and in knowing what they use, you can figure out how to shield from them. Consider that NLP directly influences the unconscious mind. When you know that the unconscious mind is one of the most commonly attacked parts of the mind when trying to influence someone else, you can remind yourself to always do self checks, understanding why you do what you are doing at any time. You can ask yourself if the behaviors that you are doing at that moment are your own, or if they are common for people that are usually manipulated. You can figure out if the thought in your mind that is driving you is your own, or if it seems out of place, or contradictory to a though that you know that you have had for ages. Effectively, when you are able to recognize the thought processes of yourself in relation to dark psychology, you can figure out whether you have been manipulated in the past. Knowing that is critical to recognizing if you are actually a victim or if you are proactive enough to avoid victimization altogether. What is true, despite the insight that you have gained, however, is that, you have earned knowledge. You have knowledge of what is possible in the world. You have knowledge about the mind and some of its secrets. You have knowledge about the predators that you may never have been aware of in reality. That is invaluable. Knowledge is power, and if you can wield that power bravely and proudly, you will be able to protect yourself. Conclusion Congratulations! That brings us to the end of Dark Psychology Secrets. Hopefully, as you read, you found the content to be compelling, interesting, informative, and easy to follow. With care, this book was designed to guide you through the world of dark psychology. Dark psychology is the look into the minds of the most heinous, monstrous humans that exist. When you are looking into the depths of dark psychology, you are looking into the minds of those who are out to hurt others. Serial killers, master manipulators, and abusers alike may share these traits, and those traits make them particularly dangerous. What is worse, however, is that these people understand psychology. They understand exactly how they need to interact with other people in order to be seen as charismatic and trustworthy enough to win a spot in the hearts of their victims and targets. The dark psychology user is able to do this simply by knowing how to manipulate their target in just the right way. However, they can only hurt and manipulate you if you give them that power. Remember, having the power to recognize and reject the abuse from the dark psychology user will be your best shield and sword from them. Not only will it help you guard against them and their attempts, you will also be able to access their minds right back. As you read through this book, perhaps the most important takeaway from it all is to remember that dark psychology itself is neutral—it is neither good nor bad. While the original wielders may have been malevolent, that does not make their weapons inherently bad as well. Remember that being able to understand dark psychology grants you a special access to the mind of someone else and you should always be mindful of how you use that access. It should not be abused in any manner. Finally, as you finish up, remember to always keep your own use of dark psychology ethical. Always ask yourself if you really need to tap into the mind of someone else. Ask yourself if the other person is the primary beneficiary if you do happen to tap into their mind. Ask yourself if they will be happy to have the end results of you tapping into their mind. If you can answer that they will be benefitted significantly and they will appreciate it, then it may be an acceptable time to use your arts. Nevertheless, as this book draws to a close, you may be wondering what comes next. Ultimately, that depends upon you. You have learned some of the basics of dark psychology. Do you want to learn more about the natural users? Do you want to learn how to fight it? Do you want to learn how to become a better user? What is your end goal? No matter what that goal is, you may find that there are several options for you to pursue from here. You could make it a point to learn how to become emotionally intelligent. This goes hand in hand with being able to persuade others with ease. You may decide to look into the process of cognitive behavioral therapy—doing so may provide you with more resources to protect yourself and heal from any manipulation that you may have identified in your life. You may decide that what is right for you is to look into the narcissist himself, learning how he abuses in order to better understand him. You may even choose to delve into psychology in general —there are several different topics that you may find to be interesting and useful in your journey from here on out. No matter what you choose, however, keep in mind that it is up to you.l No matter what anyone else tries to convince you, you deserve free will. You deserve to be able to protect that free will. You deserve to have that free will honored. As you go through the next chapter in your joumey, good luck. Hopefully, you have found what you needed within this book, and you will find what you need in the future as well. Thank you for allowing me to join you on your journey through dark psychology, and good luck as you continue. Finally, if you have found that this book has been compelling, useful, or even just generally informative, please feel free to leave a review on Amazon. Your feedback, whether good or bad, is always welcome to ensure that these books are always improving. Emotional Intelligence & Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Secrets and Techniques to Improve Mental, Cognitive, Emotional, and Relational Abilities. Overcome Depression, Anxiety, Phobia and Negative Thought Introduction Congratulations on purchasing Emotional Intelligence & Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and thank you for doing so. If you have ever felt like no matter how hard you have tried in life there always seems to be something going wrong, you are not alone. Whether you find that you are a negative person, that you suffer from anxiety, depression, or a wide range of other problematic moods, or you simply feel like your thinking is not as efficient as it could be, you may be feeling like what you need above all is to find some way to protect yourself or how to correct how you approach the situation. Many people believe that if they do suffer from anxiety or depression, the only treatment option for them is medication. While medication itself is not something to look down upon, there are also several situations during which you could choose to treat the issue behaviorally instead. Instead of assuming you have no option but to use medication, you may consider attempting to work on yourself instead. Of course, you should make this decision in tandem with your primary care provider, especially if you would have to discontinue the use of a medication in order to begin focusing solely on the behavioral aspect. You should always continue the use of your medication as directed and only wean off as directed and with a doctor’s approval. Ultimately, there are several ways that you can begin to treat yourself for issues like anxiety, depression, anger issues, and insomnia through attempts to change your behavior instead of attempts to change biology. Some people prefer traditional psychotherapy, in which they sit and talk to a therapist for an extended period of time to get to the bottom of whatever issue they are having. Other people like to use eye movement desensitization and reprocessing in order to help, especially if they find that they are suffering from forms of anxiety related to unprocessed trauma. This book, in particular, will address two specific forms of self help: Emotional intelligence and cognitive behavioral therapy. With the skills and knowledge within each of these processes, you will begin to develop the skills to tackle nearly any issues related to emotions. All you need is time, effort, patience, compassion for yourself, and a guide such as this book to give you all of the critical information you will need. As you read this book, you will be given a guide to both the topics of emotional intelligence and to cognitive behavioral therapy. Emotional intelligence will help you build up the skills and awareness you will need to be effective in a social setting, which can help mitigate anxiety and depression symptoms. Cognitive behavioral therapy can help you begin to restructure your thoughts from the ground up—literally. You will be able to change your unconscious thoughts in order to impact how you think and feel about situations. In particular, you will look at techniques that will guide you through tackling the symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and uncontrolled anger. Finally, you will be given a list of several social skills that you will find can actually help your chances of achieving your goals. Before you begin this book, remember, if you ever feel like you are a danger to yourself or others, you should always reach out for help. If you feel like you have urges to hurt yourself or to intentionally inflict harm upon others, you should consider this as a legitimate medical emergency. You do not have to feel that way, and recognizing that those feelings are wrong is only the beginning of protecting yourself. There are plenty of books on this subject on the market, thanks again for choosing this one! Every effort was made to ensure it is full of as much useful information as possible; please enjoy! Chapter 1: Emotional Intelligence Can you think of a person that you interact with regularly that does not seem to understand normal social conventions? No matter how often you interact, you may find that he is still just as clueless about basic standards and how to interact with others, and it becomes somewhat of a drain. Imagine your friend, Eric. He is someone who struggles to actually speak his mind with other people. He frequently volunteers for far more than he can actually comfortably accomplish. He tries his best to actively meet his obligations, but to no avail—he simply overcommits and it always comes back to haunt him. Of course, he then gets incredibly frustrated and tends to lash out at other people in response, despite the fact that it was his fault. He always finds a way to blame other people for his own shortcomings, and they are never his own fault. Even if he had dropped a plate out of sheer clumsiness, he is likely to blame it on the floor or on his shoes, or even the way that the sun was glaring in his eyes. This is the picture of someone lacking self awareness: A basic component of emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is a skill set that is critical to success, particularly in any setting that requires group interactions. In fact, employers will frequently choose to go for the less qualified, but still more emotionally intelligent individual over the smarter, but less emotionally intelligent individual when hiring, specifically because of all of the benefits that emotional intelligence brings with it. When you are emotionally intelligent, you are generally far more pleasant to be around, and that is something that even the best built resume cannot guarantee. You may have gotten a degree at Harvard, top of your class, but if you are not emotionally intelligent, you are going to be excruciatingly difficult to work with in any capacity. Think about Eric for a moment—he was incredibly draining to interact with simply because of the fact that he could not hold himself accountable. What is Emotional Intelligence? You may be wondering, then: What is emotional intelligence? You can understand that it is an important skillset, but why? The answer is relatively simple. Emotional intelligence is commonly defined as the ability to be aware of and control one’s own emotions while also maintaining the ability to manage relationships with others in a way that is fair and empathetic. Now, that is a bit of a mouthful. However, it can be broken down into three distinct points: e It involves the ability to understand one’s own emotions e It involves being able to avoid falling for gut reactions and emotional impulses with self regulation. e It involves being able to manage relationships with others in ways that are fair, empathetic, and beneficial Effectively, it is your ability to make sure that you are not reacting to the world like an angry preschooler. Think about how a preschooler is prone to react to almost any situation: If you take away something that a preschooler was playing with, the child may yell and scream in frustration, or try to hurt you in response. This is primarily because the preschooler is not able to self regulate. He is impulsive because the parts of his brain that are needed to manage them are not yet developed. When you are highly emotionally intelligent, you are able to remain in control instead. You are more likely to react in ways that are intelligent and Strategic rather than giving in to whatever your most recent emotional impulse was. If someone does something that angers you, you are not going to decide to run them over with your car or get back at them, simply because you know that, while anger has a specific purpose and place, it is not what you should use when managing your relationships with others. Anger is motivating, but rarely is the destruction that anger can encourage worthwhile. People naturally flock to those with emotional intelligence for one specific reason—they are far easier to deal with than those who are not. If you can make sure that you do not give in to your impulses, you are making intelligent, informed decisions on how to react. Instead of screaming that your order was delayed and will be late, you shrug it off, apologize to the intended recipient and file away in the back of your mind that you will be making it a point to order earlier next time to avoid the same problem from happening again in the future. You learn from the past and move on without letting it get you down because that is the most well adjusted manner to go about your life and motivators. In general, emotional intelligence can change from person to person, and people usually have differing amounts of emotional intelligence that has developed naturally. Some people are simply more inclined to be empathetic and self disciplined, and because of this, the picture of emotional intelligence is always different. It can present itself differently in one person over another, but what is important to remember is that it is a skill. Anyone can learn to be emotionally intelligent if they know and learn how to approach the situation, and in learning to be emotionally intelligent, you will find that you are far happier within your relationships. You will find that other people are kinder to you when you are able to regulate your own emotions and expectations, and you will find that you are more likely to be favored over someone who does not have emotional intelligence. That benefit alone makes learning the process and skillsets that much more critical. The History of Emotional Intelligence Despite the fact that the concept of emotional intelligence itself is a relatively new concept, it has always existed in some capacity. You can see it across species, with those that are highly empathetic being among the most effective leaders. In fact, oftentimes, in primates, the leaders show just as much, if not more, empathy than the females of their species. When you think about what it means to lead, this makes sense: When you are empathetic, you are able to understand the feelings of others: You can tell how the emotions of other people are impacting them and those around them. You can tell what people need because you understand their feelings. When you can understand their feelings, you are able to help them better: You feel motivated to help people more than before simply because you know how they feel and you can relate. However, in relatively recent years, this understanding of what makes a good leader a good leader has become more and more focused upon in research. The usage of the term, “emotional intelligence,” occurred for the first time in locatable history in 1964, coined by a psychology professor named Michael Beldoch. He may have named the topic, but it did not become mainstream until 1995. In 1995, with the book Emotional Intelligence, Daniel Goleman managed to push the concept of emotional intelligence into the limelight with his claims that it was crucial if people wanted to be successful in life. According to Goleman, upwards of 66% of what creates a successful individual can be directly related and attributed to emotional intelligence. When you think about it practically, this makes sense: Emotional intelligence determines how people are able to interact with others. It is how people are able to get along and solve conflicts, as well as how to build relationships. In this life, it is next to impossible to live without any interaction from other people, and this is exactly why emotional intelligence got so much support. However, despite the fact that Goleman was responsible for pushing it into popularity. There was research happening long before him. In particular, the psychologists Peter Salovey and John Mayer began to study emotional intelligence well before Goleman. They used the term with the definition that you learned above with slightly more specific language: IN particular, they defined emotional intelligence as the ability to recognize and understand the emotions of both oneself and those of others, while also being able to discriminate to decide upon which feelings should be used and which should be avoided, while actively using that ability to discriminate against emotions in interactions with others. Effectively, they were the ones who came up with a solid definition that made emotional intelligence what it is today. Salovey and Mayer, in particular, studied how to understand the concept of emotional intelligence as a whole, seeking to find out if it is necessary. Eventually, they came up with what is known as the ability model. The ability model states that there are four distinct skills that are necessary to understand emotional intelligence and to behave emotionally intelligently. These skills are: e The ability to perceive emotions, such as through nonverbal body language and expressions e The ability to reason with emotions, using them in order to promote thinking e The ability to understand emotions, learning to interpret emotions, even in difficult situations e The ability to manage emotions, such as being able to respond in the most appropriate manner, even when it is not the way you would like to behave. Not too long after Salovey and Mayer came up with their definitions, the rise of Goleman’s model quickly rose to popularity, referred to commonly as the Mixed Model of emotional intelligence. In particular, Goleman identified five components that are responsible for emotional intelligence. These five components come together to create the ability to behave in ways that are emotionally intelligent, and they are: e The ability to use self awareness e The ability to use self regulation e The ability to keep yourself motivated e The ability to be empathetic e The ability to use social skills Finally, in more recent history, a psychologist by the name of Konstantinos V. Petrides has been dabbling in his own interpretations of emotional intelligence. In fact, he came up with what was known as the Trait Model. Within the trait model, it is assumed that the perceptions of a person’s own abilities determine how people approach a situation. Effectively, if you think that you are patient, you will respond patiently far more often than someone who thinks of themselves as hotheaded. The purpose of this final model is to recognize that people will usually find that they are prone to very specific behaviors, and in learning that those methods are how they usually respond to situations, they will use that thinking to determine future behaviors. This is how people get stuck into the same actions over and over again: If you believe that you are an angry person, you are more inclined to behave angrily because you already see yourself as angry anyway. When you then respond angrily, you prove to yourself that you are, in fact, angry in general. Chapter 2: The Purpose of Emotional Intelligence Imagine that you are ready to go on a date with someone that you have been wanting to ask out for months. You finally built up the courage to approach the other person and ask for a date, but as you approach, you find that you completely stumble over the words. With your cheeks flushing in embarrassment, you need to figure out what to do next. You could yell in frustration, something that you strongly feel the urge to do. You could leave and refuse to speak to the person you wanted to ask out again because you are so embarrassed, but doing so is only going to hurt. You could try any number of different things, and you need to figure out what to do next, and quickly. How do you do it? This is a decision that will be made with your emotional intelligence in mind. If you are not particularly emotionally intelligent, you are likely to reject the idea of actually making any sort of scene that would be problematic to your chances of getting a date. You are also not likely to do something that would be embarrassing. You are more likely to choose to regroup yourself and try again because you are invested in the relationship working out. However, how likely are other people going to be to do the same? Emotional intelligence impacts everything. Because emotions drive nearly everything that we do, lurking in your subconscious mind with our minds telling us what to do and not to do through impulses, emotional intelligence is vital to every decision you make. Are you likely to behave impulsively? You likely do not have very good self control or self regulation skills, which are an important component of emotional intelligence. Are you likely to try to be the people pleaser, even though it means that you do not meet your own needs? You may be inclined to say that would be incredibly emotionally intelligent, as helping other people could be seen as having empathy, but this is actually another sign of lacking it: You are too timid to strive toward having your own needs met and choose the discomfort of not having your own needs met over the discomfort of having to face a potentially difficult situation. Emotional Intelligence in Real Life In real life, emotional intelligence has several practical uses. It actually shows up in literally every interaction that you have with other people. Even when you are by yourself, emotional intelligence is directly related to how you handle any problems that arise or the way that you view yourself. Imagine for a moment that you are in a relationship with someone else. You are quite emotionally intelligent, but your partner is not. You and your partner disagree about something, and while you are willing to disagree and move on, your partner seems wholeheartedly offended about the disagreement and claims that if you cannot change your own mind and figure out how best to assimilate with your partner’s views, then your partner does not think that the relationship is viable long term. This is an example of the difference between how someone with low and high emotional intelligence would handle that situation—the one with low EQ thinks of the situation as entirely worthless. They are driven by their emotions, and if their emotions tell them that they cannot be in a relationship with someone who disagrees with them, then they refuse to do exactly that. They will not be in that relationship simply because they would rather serve themselves than the other party. They need absolute harmony in order to feel like their relationship is secure. Is that realistic? Not really—trelationships are never perfect. There are no two people in the world that will ever have a perfect marriage without any conflict at all. Emotional intelligence includes several very important skills in order to function as well as it is supposed to. In order to be emotionally intelligent, you must be able to be self aware. The partner in the previous example was simply not. The partner was unable to recognize that it was emotions clouding the situation and that the relationship was not deserving of being dropped just because of one small disagreement. When you are self aware, you know when you are behaving in an emotional manner rather than a way that should be conducive to success and happiness. Beyond that, emotional intelligence encompasses empathy—this means that you will be using emotional intelligence every single time that you relate to someone else around you. You will be spending that time with other people and wholeheartedly expecting that the situation would be fine because you can relate and communicate. However, that relationship and communication ability comes directly from your ability to be emotionally intelligent. Consider all of the social skills that you use on a regular basis outside of self regulation and empathy. Your ability to persuade others is a trait common to emotional intelligence. Your ability to recognize the differences between people as inherently good is a sign of emotional intelligence. Essentially, if you are a good person and people genuinely enjoy being around you, you are probably emotionally intelligent. That will come back to help you in your relationships, at work, when dealing with conflicts, and even just when you are at home and got some disappointing news. In being emotionally intelligent, you are more likely to be happier, comfortable, and successful in most aspects of life. The Practicality of Emotional Intelligence This obviously makes emotional intelligence incredibly practical—if it determines the success in nearly every aspect of your life, it must be practical in some ways, right? That is exactly right. Emotional intelligence allows you to do several things. You will be able to express yourself without worrying about what other people think—consider how usually, when met with resistance from other people, it can be difficult to express your disagreement. When you are emotionally intelligent, you do not worry about it because you trust that you have the tact to handle the situation smoothly and effectively. This is a practical use—you do not have to worry about uncomfortable conversations. You are likely to be more resilient when you are emotionally intelligent as well—think of the benefit of that for a moment. This means that you can cope with disappointment and problems without immediately freaking out. So many people these days cannot handle the stress of something changing or plans having to be altered, but if you are emotionally intelligent, beyond that initial worry, you will find that change is not so scary after all. In fact, you welcome change. If that change came because something you have done has failed, you would see it as the perfect opportunity to attempt to learn from whatever went wrong the first time. This means that you will legitimately be learning from your mistakes instead of feeling like they are the biggest disappointment in the world. Perhaps the most practical skill of all, however, is not the ability to communicate, or the ability to cope with change and failure, but rather, to be a good leader. Emotional intelligence creates fantastic leaders that are able to weigh everything into consideration in order to figure out how best to approach a situation at hand. This means that if you are a good leader, you will be able to make good, clear judgments that are in everyone’s best interest, even if it is not necessarily the path that you would have chosen yourself. This is okay—it means that you are actively thinking ahead about your people, and that is what makes you such a good leader. You genuinely care about those that work with you, and you want to ensure that everyone is taken care of. Traits of Emotional Intelligence Now, let’s take a look at exactly what it is that makes someone emotionally intelligent. What are the traits that can be used to identify whether someone is actually emotionally intelligent versus simply good at faking relationships? People who are highly emotionally intelligent find that they are often quite competent when it comes to anything related to emotions. They can understand their own emotions, while also recognizing the emotions of others. They are able to relate to other people and use their own feelings to help them understand, but at the end of the day, they do not give in to their feelings. They are ultimately in control, despite the fact that their feelings may be incredibly compelling. These people are also incredibly motivated and driven—they have an intrinsic drive to them that is rare otherwise. They know that they can accomplish nearly anything, and they will always seek to better themselves. Success is rarely the endpoint for these people, and they will always strive for better, but also recognize that perfection is an impossibility. Effectively, they are chasing after practical betterment without ever aiming for an impossibility the way that some people without emotional intelligence, such as the narcissist, may do. Finally, one of the best skills of all is actually a series of skills. The emotionally intelligent individual is incredibly strong in regards to social skills. They are able to regulate themselves with ease around other people, and able to communicate like it is second nature to them—because it is. While it may have taken time to build that emotional intelligence up, with it present, it becomes like second nature to always ensure that they are able to communicate and interact with ease. These people are so good at interacting with others that they seem to make friends and develop a following no matter where they go. Everyone wants to acknowledge them and get to know them, and their own charisma seems to attract people that want to help with ease. Chapter 3: The Pillars of Emotional Intelligence As touched upon earlier, emotional intelligence comes in the form of four distinct pillars: Self awareness, self management, social awareness, and relationship management. Each of these pillars contain several other skills within them that come together, and when you are able to assemble them all in one person, you end up with someone who is emotionally intelligent. You can learn to develop each of these skillsets over time, manually working with them until you are able to be just as emotionally intelligent as those who were born with that flair naturally. Keep in mind, however, that as you develop this skill, you consider the fact that it does take time and energy. You cannot simply do two or three quick activities and suddenly declare that you are emotionally intelligent. Emotional intelligence is the culmination of the development of these skills, and that culmination only comes if you are able to actively exercise those emotional intelligence muscles. You can then think of your emotional intelligence as your body: If you do not work on it for a while and feed it nothing but junk, it is going to begin to fail you. You will become unhealthy. However, that does not mean that you have to remain unhealthy. Just as you can exercise your body in order to lose weight and build muscle and heart health, you can exercise your ability to be emotionally intelligent. Even skills such as empathy can be developed with relative simplicity if you are willing to put in the work to do SO. Now, we will take the time to go over each of the four pillars of emotional intelligence, what they entail, and the most common skills that are regularly bundled with them. As you read through this chapter, try to think about yourself and where you play out in this all. Are you emotionally intelligent? If not, what can you do to bring yourself to that level? Can you figure out where you are lacking? Try to self analyze as we go through this process, and if it helps, use a notebook in order to write down anything that comes to mind. Self awaren Social Awareness ess Pillars of Emotional Intelligence = Relation ship manage ment Self regulation Self Awareness Self awareness encompasses your ability to know what is going on with yourself at any given moment. Effectively, it allows you to know your own current state with a quick check in. In particular, you will need to be able to identify your own emotional state—knowing exactly how you are feeling at any given moment. Remember, you should know the emotion more specifically than just saying that you feel good or bad—you should be able to tell if good or bad is actually happy, angry, annoyed, disappointed, or anything else. Beyond just emotional self awareness, you must also be able to perform what is known as an accurate self assessment—this is the ability to understand your own strengths and weaknesses at any given moment and is a critical skill to have. When you can accurately self assess, you are declaring that you are well aware of your own shortcomings and aspects of your life in which you may need help. Remember, it is okay to need help sometimes—but you need to know when to ask for it. Finally, self awareness also encompasses the skill of self confidence. You need to be able to trust yourself, knowing that you are capable. In being capable, you must be willing to put your best self forward. Understanding your own abilities and how well you think that you can do them, you are able to make proper judgments on what is doable for you and what you cannot do. It does not lack self confidence if you turn down a job for legitimate means—if you do not understand how to do the job, the self confident thing to do is to reject the job altogether because you know that you are not the right fit for it and you are not ashamed to admit it. Self Management The second skillset involved in emotional intelligence is known as self management. This will encompass all of the skills that determine how well you manage or control yourself, including how well you stay on task or if you are able to ever get anything done in the first place. Those with high self management are quite self controlled—they recognize that their own emotional maturity is critical and are able to control those feelings and express them in appropriate manners in appropriate settings. This is critical—it means that you are actively making it a point to make decisions that will keep you from behaving impulsively in any way. Beyond that, you are also quite goal oriented as well. In knowing that you need to achieve things, you are able to make sure that you are always working toward them. You understand the value of goals and actively take advantage of them whenever possible. This skill is invaluable—it means that you are regularly able to keep yourself on track and organized enough to figure out how to get there. Further, that goal orientation also comes along with the ability to be motivated. You have the initiative to keep yourself moving forward, even when you are not required to do so. You will move forward simply because you want to continue to better yourself in any way possible. You are also quite transparent when you are a self manager—you are honest with everyone around you, even when that involves telling people that you have actually failed. You will always err on the side of honesty rather than trying to avoid annoying other people with lies and half truths meant to disguise your own failures. You would much rather take the fall when you need to in order to make sure that you act with integrity. This, however, also brings with it a sense of optimism. When you know that you are going to be honest with your work and with those around you, you can admit when things are going wrong and act accordingly. Because you are motivated to keep working and moving forward, you find that the optimism comes easy. Social Awareness The third pillar of emotional intelligence is social awareness. This is your ability to understand other people’s emotional states just as you were able to learn your own. Effectively, it is self awareness with some empathy sprinkled in for good measure to allow those feelings of understanding to extend to other people as well. After all, emotional intelligence is a social skill. The primary skill of social awareness is empathy. It is the ability to create connections with other people in a way that allows you to understand the emotions of others. More specifically, at this stage, you are developing a sense of emotional and cognitive empathy—this means that you are able to develop an understanding of what it is as a concept while also being able to relate to the feeling as well. People with high social awareness also tend to develop what is commonly referred to as the service orientation. This is almost like being a people pleaser but without the negative connotation. When you are able to develop this service orientation, you will find that you are always happy and willing to help contribute. You want to ensure that those around you that would be reliant on you in any way for anything at all are cared for. Think of how when you go to a restaurant, the waiter’s job is to ensure that you have everything that you need—he facilitates your ability to enjoy a good meal. He seats you and takes your orders. He brings you drinks and delivers your orders to the cook. He ensures that you get all of your orders and makes sure that everything is exactly as you wanted it to be, and finally, he helps you pay and cleans up the mess afterward. That is a service orientation—he is there to serve. When you are emotionally intelligent, you develop a similar disposition toward helping other people. You find that helping other people comes naturally and that you want to always facilitate other people’s success as well. You will do whatever you can in order to ensure that other people are well taken care of and happy. Finally, when you have a solid sense of social awareness, you are inclined to recognize organizational awareness. This is your ability to accurately judge the people with whom you are talking to and scale your own usage of language appropriately. For example, imagine that you are going to be talking to people about road safety. You are going to have a very different conversation with 5 year olds about road safety than you would have with a group of adults, and for a good reason—when you have that conversation with children, not only is their understanding of safety entirely different simply because they are younger, they are also not going to be driving a car. A talk to children about road safety would primarily encompass a discussion about ensuring that the children stay out of the road and do not cross the road without an adult or parent to facilitate. With adults, however, you may go into talk about what to do in inclement weather—many people do not know how to drive effectively in the snow, for example. You may inform people that what they need to do is get chains or snow tires or to explain that in certain weather, it is totally acceptable to slow down significantly to ensure that you are safe on the road as you drive. The ability to understand how to scale your speech to your target audience is critical. Relationship Management The final pillar of emotional intelligence is relationship management. This is effectively your ability to manage and facilitate the relationships between other people. You will effectively recognize these skills as the ideal leader skills in someone else. When you are effective as a leader, these tend to come naturally as a result. The first subskill of relationship management is becoming an inspirational leader. This can take several forms—just because you are inspirational does not mean that you have to be in the most authoritative role in the hierarchy. You can achieve this skill simply by modeling proper behaviors. You show that you are a good mentor that people can come to when they are in doubt or worried that they do not know what they are doing, and you can help facilitate them. Beyond that, you are also bound to be quite influential. In particular, you will be incredibly skilled when it comes to influence and persuasion without actively manipulating others. You will have such a way with words that you are able to efficiently and clearly motivate those around you just with your words alone. You do not need to make major promises or attempt to convince everyone else of what you want them to do—you can just get them to do it. On top of the ability to motivate with ease, you find that you also become incredibly skilled at mitigating conflicts. You are able to stop them before they can begin, but also to help settle any disputes that do arise. Because you are so skilled at looking at other people and how they interact with each other, you are able to figure out how best to improve relationships as well, and you are quite skilled at putting together teams of people that complement each other quite well. While you are solving conflicts, you may also run into situations in which you need to create change, and you are willing to do exactly that. In fact, you are more than happy to do exactly that, and you do so on a regular basis. If you feel that change is warranted, you will strive to make it happen, even if it is an unpopular opinion or if other people seem to look down on you for having that opinion in the first place. Finally, you are skilled at managing and leading teams. You are able to not only see how best to help others come to the realization that they can and should be working together to really see the best benefits, you also now recognize that there are ways to assemble your teems that will bring out the best in everyone. Not only that, you are willing to work with them as well. No job is beneath you when you are emotionally intelligent, and you are willing to do just about anything if it needs to get done. You are always happy to be a team player. Emotional Intelligence and Empathy While not one of the four key pillars of emotional intelligence, empathy deserves its own section for proper recognition. When you are empathetic, you are effectively quite capable of understanding and relating to other people with ease. You find that you have no struggles with figuring out how best to reach out to other people and find that you are regularly motivated to help. That motivation to help comes from empathy. Within empathy, when you become capable of both emotional empathy and cognitive empathy, you usually develop what is known as compassionate empathy. Compassionate empathy is your own ability to recognize what other people need and feel the need to help meet that need, if at all possible. Effectively, if you know that someone else is struggling around you, you are able to relate to them. It doesn’t matter what the struggle is; you feel like you can relate, and because you can relate, you want to help them in some way. That help may be giving food or money to the homeless person you see on the side of the road. It may be calling up a friend and offering to babysit for the weekend because you can see just how overworked she is at the moment. It could even be arranging for a fundraiser and meal train for someone going through a major medical event without them knowing about it. When you have compassionate empathy, you do not care what you have to do—you simply want to help other people, and you use that gift of empathy to do just that. This is a defining feature of being highly emotionally intelligent. In the lower pillars, it can be common for people to understand somewhat what someone else is feeling or why their feelings are important, but it takes true emotional intelligence for compassionate empathy to begin to develop. Emotional Empathy Cognitive Empathy Chapter 4: Emotional Intelligence and the Narcissist Now, if high EQ is so incredibly beneficial, what happens when there is little to no emotional intelligence in someone? Ultimately, the individual without much emotional intelligence often suffers from several important symptoms that can cause a serious upheaval in his or her life. Lacking empathy and basic social skills, they cannot relate to other people. Without any emotional regulation, they are quite impulsive. Now, before we continue to paint this picture of the individual lacking emotional intelligence, let’s stop and consider the narcissist for a moment. When most people hear the word “narcissist,” they assume that it is little more than a buzzword meant to generate clicks. However, that could not be further from the truth. Despite the fact that the name is derived from a myth, the actual disorder is a very real occurrence. What is NPD? Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is a personality disorder that is primarily characterized by a strange, distorted sense of reality. The individual suffering from NPD believes wholeheartedly that he is the best person present in the world. He acknowledges that out of everyone around, he is the best there is. He is perfection personified—no one can possibly be better than him. Since he is the best person in the world, according to him, he wants to be lavished in attention. He wants other people to acknowledge that he is the best and that no one can say otherwise. Of course, he says this with little expectation to prove it. He is so entitled that he believes that everyone else must just give him what he wants because he is that special. Ultimately, NPD is an incredibly destructive personality disorder that wreaks havoc on those suffering from it. If you suffer from narcissistic personality disorder, there is a good chance that you lack empathy, you are grandiose, you assume that you are deserving of attention, you believe that you are perfect and special, and you are going to manipulate anyone that gets in the way of any of those truths. Anyone who is on the outside looking in, however, knows the truth. Despite the fact that the narcissist’s overinflated ego is fed by his own entitlement, he is not actually deserving of that attention. He is likely not anyone like he attempts to present himself as. Ultimately, NPD is no joke. These people are manipulative, abusive, and will pretend to be someone that they are not simply because they want to get what they want. They will not stop at anything to get whatever else they have decided to get from other people. They are so self absorbed that it does not matter what happens to anyone else. In particular, someone who suffers from NPD will present with several distinctive traits—they will lack empathy. They will be exploitative and manipulative in order to ensure that they always get what they want in the situation. They will make it a point to always focus on perfection. They will believe that they are uniquely special in the world and cannot identify with anyone else. They will have a grandiose view of themselves. They will be obsessed with power, and they will feel entitled to getting that power, no matter whether they earned it or not. Effectively, the narcissist is the antithesis of someone with emotional intelligence. Emotional Intelligence and the Narcissist If the person with high EQ is capable of empathizing heavily with other people, the narcissist is not. The high EQ individual is empathetic and giving by default, whereas the narcissist is demanding and selfish. The narcissist does not care what has to be sacrificed for him, so long as the sacrifice desired actually happens. If high EQ brings with it leadership skills and admiration, both things that the narcissist desperately wants, unfortunately, the narcissist lacks in both departments. The narcissist may strive to have those two end goals, but at the end of the day, his pervasive lack of empathy makes that impossible. He cannot make proper, real relationships with other people simply because he is incapable of relating to other people. Now, you may be thinking, emotional intelligence is the solution to narcissism, right? Unfortunately, that is a bit of a complicated question. When you are narcissistic, you believe that you are perfect and always right. Part of the personality disorder is the inability to recognize when you are at fault for something. Instead of being able to admit fault and move on with the attempts to try to better him or herself, the narcissist instead doubles down and insists that nothing is wrong with him. He believes that he is fine the way he is. However, remember that a major portion of the most basic functions of emotional intelligence were self awareness and self regulation. The narcissist has none. The narcissist does not accurately self assess and does not see anything as a weakness—everything must be a strength at all times. The narcissist does not regulate emotions—if anyone angers him, he will lash out at anyone around without holding back. The narcissist is, effectively, almost untreatable because of these pervasive beliefs. In order for emotional intelligence to be effective, the narcissist would have to admit that he had a problem in the first place, and anyone familiar with a narcissist would know that would never happen. The narcissist is never going to admit fault or admit that something as fundamental as his personality was flawed with a disorder. Imagine for a moment that you are friends with a narcissist. You may be the most emotionally intelligent individual in the world, but if the narcissist is not willing to work with you, even your own empathy is not enough in the long term to cope with the stress of the narcissist. The narcissist will always be so caught up in his own ego, demanding attention and support from other people and expecting lavish acknowledgment anywhere he goes, he will never be willing to put other people first. At some point, it becomes a matter of needing to move on past the narcissist without allowing it to bother you any longer. If you can do this, you will effectively allow yourself to step away from the disaster sooner rather than later. Yes, if you are emotionally intelligent or empathetic, this will go against any instincts that you have, which may be actively directing you toward helping the narcissist, but remember that helping will not do any good for someone who does not want to be saved. You can lead a horse to water, but you cannot force it to drink, and at the end of the day, the narcissist will never drink from any water that is meant to bring him back to earth. He would rather force the world to fit into his own method of thinking, expecting everyone else to make things easier for him rather than him having to change. He assumes that he is so incredibly valuable that people would do anything to keep him. Chapter 5: Intro to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Emotional intelligence itself can be an incredibly valuable skill set to develop, but what happens when you run into roadblocks? What if you feel like you cannot possibly continue to move forward in your attempts to become emotionally intelligent because your emotional state is too out of whack? Maybe you find that your self confidence is so incredibly poor that you cannot manage to even convince yourself that people actually genuinely like you. Maybe your anger keeps you down and you cannot figure out how best to regulate it. If you find that emotional intelligence becomes too difficult to push through, there may be an issue with your way of thinking. Luckily for you, you can fix that. All you will need to do is work through what is commonly known as cognitive behavioral therapy. CBT is a technique that is regularly used in several different aspects now, sort of as a cure all for many mental health disorders. People have seen improvements in several mental health issues with the use of CBT, ranging from depression and anxiety to even seeing a decrease in distress caused by schizophrenia. Even better, CBT is brief—the average session only lasts about 10 office visits, and then you are off on your own to keep managing yourself. Does this sound too good to be true? Despite how sweetly impossible that this sounds, it is legitimate and recognized by even the United States Military as a treatment plan for veterans with post traumatic stress disorder. This means that CBT is an effective way to treat several different disorders while also being incredibly brief, making it a dream come true to many people that do not want to spend their lives in therapy. Within this chapter, we will go over the most basic features of what cognitive behavioral therapy is, how it works, and why it is frequently used. Try to reserve judgment until the end of the chapter—despite the fact that it does sound like it is too good to be true, it is legitimate. What is CBT? Cognitive behavioral therapy is a form of psychotherapy. This means that it is primarily talk based in order to get to the root of what is going on in your mind. However, it differs greatly from what you may be used to thinking of when discussing therapy. Unlike how in traditional psychotherapy appointments, you may be sitting there, discussing random aspects of your life for weeks or months on end, CBT instead encourages you to make a handful of appointments to learn how to cope with whatever is bothering you. Effectively, CBT cuts out the middle man—instead of having the therapist figure out what the problem is and how to solve it, the therapist teaches the patient how to figure out that information for himself. The therapist will provide the patient with information on how best to recognize the signs of whatever may be suspected, as well as guide the patient through several coping mechanisms that are meant to help deal with the negative emotions in order to end problematic behaviors. CBT is so incredibly effective for three specific reasons: It is brief, action oriented and focused on the present rather than looking at past problems. Present focused Despite being brief, the patient is taught plenty of actionable information to help him or her cope with what is going on in life. They are taught to identify emotional states, understand what those states mean, and then learn to discredit those emotional states until they pass to avoid falling for any sort of impulsive emotional behaviors that could lead to problems later on. Along with being brief, it focuses specifically on actions. In CBT, you identify what the most problematic aspects of your life are and then you figure out how best to handle them. This may be through figuring out how to fend off anxiety, for example. If you are an anxious person, you may find that you are better off learning to treat that anxiety. That anxiety will be treated through methods like graded exposure or attempts to create affirmations or roleplays to eliminate the fear. Instead of essentially talking about the feeling until it no longer hurts ,;CBT seeks to figure out how to remove the power from the feeling altogether. In removing the power, it can no longer be harmful in the future, meaning that the problem is solved. However, the methods that are taught in CBT are open ended—just because that one anxiety problem is over does not mean that anxiety will never plague you again in the future, and for that particular reason, the actions that you are taught are never assigned to one particular behavior. If you are anxious, you may find use of that affirmation assignment, but what about if you were frustrated? Would that affirmation still help? Maybe if you wrote new one about your frustration, but that would be a fantastic idea. They are meant to be useful in several contexts in order to maximize usability. Finally, CBT really only focuses on present tense problems. While it would be foolish to believe that those suffering from anxiety have only had anxiety as a recent issue with a recent trigger, it is important to note that those who are suffering from anxiety should also be able to treat their current triggers without trying to figure out when it all started. After all, if the end goal here is to create strategies to cope with a specific symptom, does it matter when that symptom started? Does the cause of the broken bone really help the doctor re set your bone or make sure that it heals, right? Of course, it would be foolish to completely disregard the past—the past can provide important information that is incredibly insightful into the situation, but at the same time, it is imperative to remember that solving past traumas is not always more important than figuring out how to prevent new ones. When you allow someone to develop a strategy toward healing, you are making it clear that they are able to cope in the moment. You make sure that if that person has a panic attack, those CBT techniques are there right then to help them out of that panic attack. Figuring out the direct cause and start of the panic attacks is not as important in the short term, and CBT takes exactly that stance. How CBT Works Ultimately, CBT works primarily because it takes a close look at how behaviors and thoughts are innately related to each other. While it may intentionally hone in on behaviors, that is more because behaviors are far simpler to observe than any other forms. You can tell what someone is doing at a glance but you cannot always tell the emotional tone of someone just by their glance. This cycle between behaviors and thoughts actually has one more point—it is the thoughts feelings behaviors chart. Effectively, our thoughts influence our feelings. If you think that you are useless, you will feel like you have no self confidence. Without self confidence, you will not be willing to apply for that job that you really need. If you do not apply to that job, you obviously never get that job, and you are once again caught up in how horrible you are and how much you wish that you could change yourself into someone else. aay Actions Thoughts Feelings That means that the cycle has officially come full circle. You thought that you were useless, felt like you were useless, were useless as a direct result of those thoughts, and then continued to use that as evidence of how useless you are. This is exactly why negative feelings can be so incredibly difficult to leave implanted in someone else—when they are there, that other person is going to have to work incredibly hard to get those negative feelings out in a process that is known as cognitive restructuring. Cognitive restructuring is effectively the backbone of CBT at this point—it is the ability to stop, analyze your own thoughts, and then change your own thoughts with other techniques. In doing so, you may find that it actually does, in fact, work. The reason it works is because it breaks into that cycle mentioned above—if negative thoughts make negative feelings, which makes for negative behavior, what happens if there is a shift to positive feelings instead? For example, what if you replaced the thought of being useless with a thought about trying hard to change your tendencies as a negative individual? If you were to change that particular thought, you would need to somehow get it implanted into your brain and then figure out the best way to constantly be reinforcing it. At first, that positive thought is in your mind, but you find it difficult to use. This makes sense—It is a difficult subject to approach and yet approaching it is the only right choice. So, after insisting that you are trying your hardest in life and seeing the girl from the bar that you failed to strike up a conversation with despite your desires to do so, you build up that resolve and approach her. Of course, just approaching, something you were terrified of doing, is enough to help you start to feel a little more confident and successful. Your thought processes begin to help you become successful. You find that the more positive language that you use, the more positive you feel. The more positive that you feel, the more likely you feel to actually behave in a positive manner. Effectively, then, you are able to defeat key issues in your life, one at a time. Do you have anxiety? You can figure out how to eliminate that anxious response from the internet or a book like this one. Are you lonely and want to find a date? You can do that too, so long as you actively go out of your way to try to do so. No matter what your mental health issue is, there is almost always a way that you can use CBT to better cope with it in some way or another. It is important to note, however, if you are going to be using CBT, it needs to be reinforced regularly. You want to ensure that it remains effective, and the best way to do so is to repeatedly flex the muscles that you would use involving CBT in the first place. This means that if CBT helps you with anxiety, use it with your anxiety symptoms as much as you can. Even if you feel like the symptoms are not that bad, try to use them. You will find that you are able to reinforce them better and more effectively simply by using them on the regular. Why CBT is Used Ultimately, CBT is used for several important reasons. At its root, what it does is identify and change negative thinking patterns and with that in mind, it is important to recognize just how powerful that is. Negative thinking patterns spread negativity throughout your life. The more negatively that you think, the more negativity you will find infesting your life. This is perhaps the primary use of CBT. However, think about all of the areas in your life in which negative thinking may hurt your behaviors? Imagine how you feel when your anxiety flares up—is there a negative thought behind it? Most likely. Do you have anger issues? There may very well be some negative thoughts underlying those as well. At the end of the day, the only way to know where the negative thoughts are is to figure out how to identify them—and CBT does that. Negative thoughts can cause all sorts of problems. You may find that negative thinking causes an eating disorder or a phobia. It could cause drug or alcohol misuse, or lead to struggles with all sorts of personality disorders. Effectively, however, the best way to figure out whether a negative thought is at the root of any reason that you are struggling is through plenty of self reflection. Negative Thinking and CBT Negative thinking is typically quite rigid—you cannot change it despite any efforts that you make to do exactly that. No matter how hard you try, you may find that you are caught up in the negativity. Unfortunately, however, recognizing negative thinking is something that is incredibly difficult if you do not understand what you are doing. You need to be able to recognize your negative thoughts if you hope to ever have a chance to help eliminate them. When there are negative thoughts in your life, you may find that rather than actually recognizing the negativity, all you recognize is that life is going wrong somewhere for you. You do not see that the thought is at the root— just that nothing seems to work out. You may find that you are repeatedly rejected from job interviews, or find that you constantly struggle to get people to hang out with you. In the end, you find that you feel all alone with no clear idea of how to fix it. Finding the negative though in your life is probably the best, most clear cut method to ensuring that you can identify the reason everything seems to be going wrong. The process to do this can take a while, but it is absolutely worth doing. To start, figure out when the last time that you were incredibly upset or angry was. Do you remember what caused the feelings? Write down as much as you can about the situation on the paper. Perhaps you remember that you were upset over the fact that your friend would not hang out with you again, after having already cancelled on you twice in the last week. It left you feeling incredibly upset and worthless, and in response, you spiraled into all sorts of negative thinking. You told yourself that you failed as a friend, and that is exactly why your friends keep bailing on you. You told yourself that you are impossible to get along with and that those around you will never want to. You may have told yourself that you hate who you are, which only pushed you deeper into negativity. Now that you have that out on your paper, ask yourself to summarize that entire paragraph written down to one sentence: “I am a bad friend.” With that thought in mind, can you figure out why it matters? What makes that thought so powerful? Why does it matter so much? The answer is likely something about how you feel like you are a worthless person or something along those lines. Ask why that matters, and continue to reduce down your realization over and over again. You want to keep asking yourself what that previous sentence says about you until you reach the point of having a sentence that is entirely about you: “T am a bad person,” for example. That right there is a core thought. A core thought is a thought that you have that underlies everything else. It is effectively the unconscious bias about a situation or setting that pushes you to behave in a certain way or to think in a certain way. In this case, your thought of being a bad person pushed yourself to think that your friend hated you, wanted nothing to do with you, and would have been happier with you gone forever. Was any of that actually true? Most likely not, and yet you could not help but think it anyway. Nevertheless, with that thought process in mind, it is important to write it down. Record that core thought and keep it close for now. You are going to be analyzing it to determine whether it is negative or simply problematic. Negative automatic core thoughts are effectively some of the most destructive that you can have, and if you are able to identify them, cognitive restructuring is always the way to go. You can do the restructuring in the process that is provided in this book, or you can attempt to do so with the help of a therapist. Ultimately, all that matters is that you succeed in eliminating the automatic thought once and for all. Now that you have your core thought written down, it is time to figure out if it is a negative thought or not. You can do this by simply running it through a checklist. This checklist will be your sort of cheat sheet—it will contain the most common forms of negative thinking patterns so you can cross check your own core thought to determine if it is problematic. If it is problematic, you will want to change that thought as quickly and as effectively as you can without risking waiting too long. There are dozens of negative thinking patterns, but for the most part, they will fall into one of ten categories. These categories are all or nothing thinking, focusing on the negatives, pessimism, need for approval, negative self labeling, catastrophizing, dwelling on the past, mind reading, focusing on the should, and disqualifying the present. Each of these serves its own purpose. Let’s take a short look at each of these ten negative thinking patterns to get a good idea of what they are in action. All or nothing thinking involves you telling yourself that you must do things one way and anything short of that one perfected manner is a failure. If you do not get 100% on that test, then you have failed it. Effectively, this is perfectionism written into a thought. Focusing on the negative involves putting an excessive amount of effort into the bad part of a situation. If you had a date and it rained, for example, you may focus on all of the negativity—it rained, so you couldn’t go for that romantic walk. Your shoes got all wet and dirty and now you need to scrub them. The whole day and date were a complete failure. In reality, the other person was thrilled to spend the time with you and would have happily described the date as good. Pessimism is quite similar to focusing on the negative. Unlike how focusing on the negative was looking at the past, pessimism focuses on the future with a negative outlook. If something goes wrong, you constantly think that something bad is going to happen in response. If anything is successful, you believe it is for sure, only going to be temporary before falling apart as well. A need for approval is a definite sign of low self esteem or major personal damage. When you need approval from other people, you feel like the only value you have is tied up in how other people see you. If you are not liked, you are not worthy of anything. Negative self labeling is the act of telling yourself that you are something that is negative or bad. You may tell yourself that you are a waste of space or that you would even waste space in the garbage can and that your only value would be in disappearing. This is usually incredibly disparaging toward yourself and is incredibly harmful. Catastrophizing is the act of telling yourself that it will always be the worst case scenario that happens. Things will never go well—you will always fail. Dwelling on the past is quite similar to focusing on the negative, but the difference is that when you dwell, you are actively telling yourself that the problem is in the past and that you cannot fix it. Instead of looking toward the future and seeing that there are solutions for you out there, you are actively avoiding making any real progress. Instead, you say that you may as well continue to beat yourself up over that mistake so you can eventually feel better. Mind reading is the mistake of deciding that you know exactly what is going through the minds of others. Instead of seeing that other people have privacy to their own minds and that there is no way you could ever figure out what is going on inside it without asking, and even then, you cannot guarantee anything, you decide that you know exactly what the problem is —you are the problem. You do not need any evidence for this; you simply decide that you are the problem because you know it. Focusing on the ‘shoulds’ involves getting so caught up in the fact that life should be fair and people should have access to the same basic amenities. However, life is not fair. It has never been fair. Some people win and some lose, and ultimately, you need to accept that. It sucks to not get what someone else gets, but that is life. Disqualifying the present is the exact opposite of focusing on the past. When you do this, you actively trap yourself into telling yourself that you will take care of yourself or do something for yourself in the future after you have already had the chance to figure out what was going on at that moment. With that list of negative thoughts, it is time to start figuring out how likely your own thought fits into one of the listed categories. If you say that you are a bad person, you are likely falling for negative self labeling at the very lest. You are telling yourself that you are something that you are not. No one ever said you were a bad person. You also fell for the negative thinking of mind reading. Your friend never said why they canceled, and you assumed that it was because of you being a bad person and that it always happens that way. Effectively, the more time that you spend dwelling and trying to figure things out, the more negative thought patterns that you inadvertently dig up just through realizing that they qualify. In identifying that negative thought, however, you do make it clear that what you need is cognitive restructuring to destroy it. The cognitive restructuring process has several steps and does take time, but it is absolutely critical to beginning to defeat those negative thought processes once and for all. You can do it if you are willing and able to go through the effort. Begin by calming yourself down—you want to make sure that you are able to relax. You can do this through meditation or a breathing exercise if you want to, or you can simply wait until you are calmed down enough to begin. You can skip the next two steps if you have already gone through identifying negative thoughts. If you are skipping the identification of negative thoughts prior, you can continue. With a state of calmness, identify what caused the negativity in the first place. What happened? What triggered the negativity that you are feeling right at that moment? Write it all down for yourself—you want to figure out the moods that you had so you can begin to reflect on it later. After all, emotions are incredibly powerful. In this case, you may write down that the problem is that your friend stood you up and you feel angry, lonely, and embarrassed that you are constantly being canceled on. Next, it is time to identify your automatic thoughts. This was the step in which you made it through your natural chain of events with the argument with yourself. You told yourself that you were not good enough and eventually arrived at the conclusion of not being good enough. At this point, it is time to begin again if you have already worked on finding negative thoughts earlier in the chapter. You will be finding any evidence that supports the negative thought that you had. If you are such a bad person, how can you prove it? You will need to look at the situation entirely objectively and figure out how best to prove that thought to yourself somehow. Do your best to do this. You may write down that if you were left out, you were obviously not wanted by the group to begin with, along with some other comments that are meant to support whatever you have declared. From there you need to figure out if there is any contradicting evidence. What can you do to prove that thought wrong? How can you prove that you are not a bad person? This is important—this is where you start to acknowledge that the negative thought is wrong or flawed. You may tell yourself that your evidence is that people always say hi to you when you get to work, or that your cubicle neighbor brought you mini cupcakes and a balloon on your birthday. You may remind yourself that your friends do usually make time for you, but it is a busy part of the year, and you had admittedly canceled a few times as well simply because the business was just too much to keep up with at that point in time. As you write these thoughts down, compare them to the list of thoughts that you had set up for yourself as evidence of your negative thought. How much actually fits there? Was it actually fair to yourself to tell yourself that you are not liked, wanted, or that you are a bad person? Ultimately, it is incredibly unfair to you to put that standard on you, but you will arrive at that conclusion shortly. Now that you have your two lists, it is time to weigh them. Which side seems to be more accurate? In all honesty with yourself, you would have to agree that the thoughts being discredited seemed more rational, reasonable, and honest. At this point, you should feel a little bit better. You are able to remind yourself of exactly how the thoughts that you initially had were wrong or negative and should be avoided. At this point, it is time to try to help yourself continue to feel better. Write down what you have done and the end results of your process of self reflection. See how you feel after doing that. Remind yourself that the balanced outlook was far better for you. Ask yourself how to avoid falling down that chain of negative thinking again in the future, and then remind yourself that it is important for you to offer yourself some compassion every now and then. Finally, to help reiterate your newfound viewpoint of the situation, it can help to create some affirmations. These affirmations will exist as your sort of reminder that things are not as bad as they may initially seem and that you can keep your thinking in the positive if you work at it enough. Affirmations will be addressed in depth later in this book in Chapter 8: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Techniques to Eliminate Anxiety. Chapter 6: Cognitive Therapy and Behavioral Therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy acts as a sort of bridge between both cognitive therapy and behavioral therapy. Drawing from both, it finds ways to understand and influence behavior in methods that would not entirely be possible without them both. Effectively, when you are using cognitive behavioral therapy, you are using one of the most powerful, influential forms of therapy for the time. It takes the best of cognitive therapy, recognizing that we are a sum of our thoughts and that our thoughts influence our behaviors. It also recognizes that our thoughts are directly influenced by the environment around us, one of the facets of behavioral therapy. When you are using CBT, you are effectively getting all of the benefits of both therapies at the same time, and the result is incredibly effective. It is difficult to argue with statistics that strongly support the effectiveness and veracity of CBT as a therapy—it is active and effective, allowing for the reconstruction of both thoughts and behaviors. In the end, in tackling both perspectives at the same time, people get a treatment method that is able to handle nearly anything. The best way to understand CBT, however, is to look at each of its components. Within this chapter, we will seek to understand both cognitive and behavioral therapies, allowing you to see what the main purposes of both of them are. In seeing the expectations and tendencies of both therapies outlined for you, you may realize that CBT is the sort of perfect blend between the two, and that is what makes it so incredibly powerful. Understanding Cognitive Therapy Cognitive therapy itself is best understood by the idea that the individual’s thoughts are influential to the individual’s feelings. Within this perspective, the emotional response felt is typically a direct response to a situation at hand. Effectively, your feelings are usually caused by your thoughts on a Situation. Imagine that you are greatly afraid of dogs. You were bitten as a young child and never managed to overcome the overwhelming fear that washes over you when you see another dog that is larger than a Chihuahua. In this instance, you have just found yourself exposed to someone walking a Great Dane down the road .The dog is perfectly well behaved, but you cannot seem to tolerate the sight of it. Your heart starts to race. You feel your breathing grow shallow and rapid. You look around you and there is no clear escape from the individual without dipping into someone’s yard and trying to get into an alleyway. You are effectively trapped. You can keep walking toward the dog, or you can walk in the same direction as the dog, but either way, you are going to be stuck in close proximity to it. Now, if you had randomly felt those symptoms sitting around and doing nothing, you may have been concerned that there was something wrong with you medically—it is always distressing to have that racing heart and the shortness of breath. However, in this instance, you are well acquainted with the feeling—anxiety. You are feeling anxiety at the situation because you are afraid of the dog. In cognitive therapy, the therapist asserts that the reason that you are afraid is not that dogs are inherently scary, but rather because your thoughts about the dog make it scary. Effectively, your thoughts are directly swaying your feelings. You have negative thoughts surrounding dogs, stemming from the attack that you suffered, and despite knowing that, you can still never seem to overcome your phobia in any meaningful way. You still feel that same sense of panic when approached by a dog. Effectively, cognitive therapy states that the thoughts that you have surrounding that dog is biased and, therefore, not particularly suitable for functionality. You then build up your own negative thoughts surrounding the situation, and those thoughts color your emotions. This means, however, that you can tackle that fear relatively easily—all you need to do is figure out how best to address the situation. You can learn to process your thoughts in order to free your feelings once and for all. When you are in cognitive therapy, you are directly being taught by your therapist to develop new skillsets to help you. The skillset in particular that you will be learning includes several abilities and concepts familiar to anyone that knows their cognitive behavioral therapy. You will learn how to tell the difference between thoughts and feelings, which will enable you to remove the power from many of those negative thoughts as they arise. When you can tell the difference between the two, you can acknowledge that you are not actually frightened of the dog, you are frightened because you think the dog is scary. You discover the cycle in which thoughts, including automatic thoughts, influence feelings, and how that can be problematic if the thoughts that you have driving your feelings are negative. These negative or distorted thoughts can be incredibly problematic in nearly any context. They will make it next to impossible for you to actively manage the situations at hand, and correcting those thoughts is crucial if you hope to be able to manage your emotions. You will discover how to critically evaluate your automatic thoughts in order to determine if they are accurate or biased. In knowing that some of the thoughts that you are having are biased, you can begin to overcome them, defeating them with the reminders of their biased nature. Effectively, this teaches you to figure out how to interrupt and restructure your biased thoughts as they arise, allowing you to better your emotional state. Cognitive Therapy e Thoughts determine feelings e Understanding how thoughts influence feelings gives the power to defend against these feelings e Negative automatic thoughts are primarily at fault for neagtive feelings Understanding Behavioral Therapy Behavioral therapy, on the other hand, seeks to identify how any thoughts that you have get rewarded or reinforced over time, even if by accident. Within the behavioral therapy perspective, you are able to acknowledge that sometimes, we accidentally reinforce negative thoughts and biases, and in reinforcing them, we make them that much more likely to continue. For example, let’s go back to being afraid of dogs—you are terrified of the dogs that you encounter from day to day. This is typical. However, every time that you respond in a manner that is afraid of dogs, you avoid a negative interaction with the dog. This then leads to your fear of being reinforced. You may also run into the problem of reinforcing your fear every time you read an article online about how dogs have attacked or maimed people in your general vicinity. Overall, you constantly find yourself struggling to interact with dogs, and the longer your fear lasts, the longer you reinforce it. A slightly different version of this is in recognizing the ways in which you can run into a problem with children. For example, imagine that you have a child that regularly throws temper tantrums when he wants something. You do not want to give in to what he wants and you do your best to avoid it. However, occasionally, you feel like it is not worth the battle and you simply give in to the boy instead, feeling like it is preferable to the option of simply refusing and dealing with the headache surrounding standing your ground. Although you may see this as attempting to avoid a tantrum that you simply do not want to put up with because you are tired, your child has just been reinforced. You made it clear that if your child threatens to throw a fit, he gets what he wants. His behavior just reinforced his thoughts. Behavior Therapy è Behaviors that are reinforced get repeated e Negative behaviors have been inadvertently reinforced into being repeated e New behaviors must be encouraged to replace the negative ones When Cognitive and Behavioral Therapy Collide Now, consider what this means for CBT—you can see aspects of both cognitive and behavioral therapy in what has formed with CBT. In particular, you recognize that the cognitive therapy concept of thoughts influencing feelings being involved. You see that therapy is meant to be actionable and designed to restructure thoughts in order to change the feelings. When you restructure thoughts, you are actively engaging in one of the primary principles of CBT—you are making sure that you tackle problematic negative thoughts and turn them instead into something functional. Now look at behavioral therapy—in particular, you see the idea that behaviors reinforce thoughts. This is the last half of the cycle in CBT that involves thoughts, behaviors, and feelings. When you are able to acknowledge this cycle, you can begin to engage in all of the processes that CBT boasts as being it’s most effective. The behavioral portion of CBT encourages people to try new things, allowing for the creation of positive associations, such as through acts like goal setting and behavior activation, in which you are able to actively begin to create new behavioral patterns and reinforce them, allowing them to become as automatic as the negative ones. Essentially, CBT wanted to combine the two, bridging the gaps and making use of all techniques and possibilities. Within CBT, you see that people are taught to restructure their own thoughts, but they are also taught to avoid reinforcing negative thoughts. You are able to ensure that you are actively working toward bettering who you are, what you want, and how you will get it all because you will be tackling the problem from two different perspectives to ensure that the end results are as effective as possible. yioral Thera Chapter 7: Anxiety Imagine that you are sitting at home, minding your own business when your heart starts to race. You had been just fine moments prior and now you cannot help but feel that sense of panic and dread within you—you cannot shake the feeling that you are being followed, watched, or being threatened, and no matter how much you walk yourself through the logic of why you are safe and not needing to worry, you find that the feeling of dread will not pass. You do your best to mitigate it, and yet you cannot help but feel like you are stuck. Your best attempts do nothing and you begin to wonder if you are actually dying, in danger, or otherwise threatened or compromised. In reality, you are perfectly okay, physically. You are feeling the sensation of anxiety. This is your body’s natural response to stress, during which you are actively afraid of what is to come. Your anxiety triggers could be anything—arguing, bills coming due, or even an offhanded comment toward your partner about something entirely irrelevant to everything. What is true and constant, however, is the overwhelming, terrifying sensation that you are in real danger. When you are anxious, you are suffering from a mental health disorder. This does not mean that you should feel ashamed—you cannot help that your body is reacting in this way. However, you can reclaim your body and begin to treat it. This chapter will guide you through understanding anxiety as a disorder, walk you through the most common disorders there are, and then discuss how CBT is a valid solution for those suffering from anxiety. In the next chapter, you will be provided with three techniques that you can use in order to begin taking back your life and fighting off that anxiety once and for all. While it can be intimidating to try to figure out how to help yourself, know that you are doing the best that you can by making an effort to heal who you are and change the patterns through which you will live your life. You will be able to heal yourself and ensure that you are able to be happy and healthy once more. What is Anxiety? Anxiety is, first and foremost, a feeling. It is the feeling of apprehension and fear of what is going to come next. You fear what will happen and react accordingly. Effectively, your mind is on overdrive, feeling like there is a threat, even if that threat is imaginary. In response to that threat, your body has several options. It can choose to fight, it can choose to flee, or it can choose to freeze. Typically, when you are suffering from anxiety, your body has chosen flight as its proper response—it wants to get you as far away from the situation as possible by making you as uncomfortable as possible. Essentially, anxiety is a state o nearly constant vigilance. When you are afraid for your life, you are not going to be able to rest—you will actively be searching for any signs that you were correct and that there really is a threat to your safety present somewhere nearby. When you are able to remain vigilant, you are effectively making it a point to defend yourself from all angles. However, keep in mind the massive amount of stress that this would put anyone under. When you are stressed out about how to approach people, or even just how to live life, you are not going to be very happy. You are going to struggle in nearly any interactions, constantly worrying about whether this will be the one to trigger your anxiety or make continuing on with your life impossible. Very quickly, that anxiety spirals out of control, and you find that it is impossible to remain clearheaded and capable. Of all the mental health disorders that you could ever have, anxiety is the most common. It is pervasive—it arises over the course of several different interactions and in several constant situations. It is problematic—it makes normal functioning impossible. Finally, it is also debilitating. It is possible for those who suffer from anxiety to find that instead of being able to protect themselves and ensure that they are taking care of themselves, they are going to be suffering from those feelings of fear and trying to escape it. Anxiety Disorders Anxiety exists in a multitude of forms. You can have panic disorder, in which certain stimuli actively trigger you to panic and act as if your very life is being threatened. You can have a phobia or social anxiety. Ultimately, at the end of the day, the end result is still the same: You are still afraid of what is going to happen and you are still struggling to figure out how best to cope. When you are actively afraid of what is around you, you can hardly expect to function effectively. This section will help you identify several of the most common anxiety disorders. As you read, however, keep in mind that the information included in this chapter does not substitute for a proper, licensed medical professional’s diagnosis and opinion. If you think that you may be suffering from anxiety, the best course of action is always to make sure that you get a proper diagnosis from a medical professional who has had the opportunity to both understand your symptoms through interacting with you, but is also able to supervise over the process of treating you. While it is great to use this book as a guide, it is even more beneficial to your treatment plan to seek professional medical advice from someone that can see the whole picture and interact to create something tailored to you specifically. Panic disorder is a common anxiety disorder in which people experience repeated panic attacks entirely unexpectedly. These attacks are sudden, powerful, and incredibly draining, leaving the individual feeling like he or she may be dying when in reality, their anxiety is creating symptoms that are incredibly reminiscent of cardiac arrest. People who suffer from panic disorder find that they suffer from at least one panic attack per month, and they are beginning to be fearful of the idea of having another panic attack. Effectively, knowing that there is an opportunity for another panic attack is enough to trigger more anxiety. These panic attacks show up without warning, with symptoms such as heart palpitations, struggling to breathe, a sensation of choking, lightheadedness, dizziness, and chest pain, among others. These symptoms usually arise with no discernable reason and occur in ways that are incredibly powerful. They leave the individual functioning in fear of another attack. Phobias are another form of anxiety that manifests as an irrational, excessive fear of one specific trigger. This trigger could be something physical, such as a specific animal or person, or it could be a bit more abstract, such as the fear of a thought or the fear of a feeling. In fact, some people even find that they may end up living in fear of leaving home, something else that can be incredibly problematic. When you suffer from a phobia, you are not just slightly afraid of whatever is happening—you are deathly afraid of it. For example, consider the scenario of being afraid of dogs. If you are so afraid of the dog that you let it control your life, intentionally and deliberately avoiding the dog by crossing the street or changing your routine, you may suffer from a phobia. Most of the time, these phobias do directly impact your ability to function. They interfere with your ability to recognize situations in a healthy manner. Generalized Anxiety Disorder is what most people usually think about when they think of anxiety—it is characterized by random bouts of feelings of anxiety that are oftentimes unpredictable, while other times being quite obvious. When you suffer from generalized anxiety disorder, most of the time, you cannot help it. You cannot figure out how best to function and cannot shake the feeling without help. Thankfully, that help is available to you. If you feel like you suffer from a constant overarching feeling of anxiety that you cannot explain, you are not alone, and you do not have to suffer endlessly. You can treat this problem. Post traumatic stress disorder is the development of severe anxiety symptoms in direct response to some sort of trauma. It is not known exactly what causes PTSD to arise, as not everyone who has suffered a trauma goes through it. When you suffer from PTSD, you find that you have an intense avoidance of anything even remotely reminiscent of whatever trauma you have experienced. You may suffer from intrusive thoughts, such as flashbacks or nightmares related to the trauma, or you may find that, despite your best attempts, you cannot shake the need to obsessively avoid anything reminiscent of the trauma in the first place. Keep in mind that, while commonly associated with the military, you do not actually have to serve in the military to suffer from PTSD any trauma, ranging from sexual assault to surviving a major accident can result in the symptoms. CBT and Anxiety Ultimately, CBT is an incredibly effective method through which you can treat your anxiety. When you use CBT to tackle your anxiety issues, you are tackling the issue from two ends. You spend time identifying problematic thoughts that may have become distorted over time, and you also spend time actively attempting to reinforce positive behaviors. If you are actively suffering from anxiety, cognitive behavioral therapy is one of the best therapies you can choose in order to alleviate the symptoms. Through CBT, you will learn how to act accordingly—you will be given several tools for managing those feelings of negativity and anxiety to remove the discomfort and distress that goes along with them. For example, if your anxiety tends to express itself through the massive feelings of panic, a racing heart, and a fear of dying, CBT can help you eliminate the distress behind those symptoms. Effectively, CBT would teach you that it is okay to feel that way, but ultimately, your anxiety is little more than feelings to begin with. This means that if you want to treat it, there are several options for you. You can choose to use affirmations to remove the discomfort, reminding you that you are safe. You can choose to expose yourself to your triggers in hopes of desensitizing yourself form the symptoms altogether. You can even choose to spend time practicing through several worst case scenarios in order to figure out the best possible approach to your symptoms. No matter what you choose, however, there will always be the option to revisit another method if necessary. You will be able to choose to instead behave in other ways and slowly habituate those new behaviors. Over time, you will see relief. While it may have been difficult to first begin the process of treating your anxiety, you should always remember that it takes real strength to treat a mental health disorder and that you should not be ashamed under any circumstances. Rather, you should be proud of yourself to be willing to give yourself a chance. Chapter 8: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Techniques to Eliminate Anxiety Once diagnosed with anxiety, you may wonder what comes next. Luckily, what comes next is effectively just skills building. You will be spending the time to learn new skills that you can use to claim and tame your anxiety once and for all. These three methods of treatment, the ability to create affirmations, graded exposure, and using what if roleplays will all be particularly effective in ensuring that, no matter what the situation, you are able to tame that anxiety. Even if you have not yet been diagnosed, but you feel le you are probably well on your way to getting that diagnosis, it can really help to begin to process of tackling those anxiety triggers early on. From here on out, it is assumed that you are already familiar with the art of identifying problematic thoughts—this ability to use introspection will be crucial to your ability to succeed. Since this process was introduced in Chapter 5, you should already have a general idea of how best to identify these thoughts. When you know what your problematic thoughts are, you can begin to tackle them. Affirmations Affirmations are little more than short statements that you repeat to yourself during a moment of weakness. Effectively, your affirmation should directly counter a negative thought that you are suffering from in a way that helps you to stay focused on what you want and grounded to your truest emotions instead of just trying to squeak past the sensation of anxiety in the first place. In particular, affirmations are one of the simplest methods that you can use. All you need to identify is to ensure that it meets three simple requirements. You must make sure that your affirmation is positive—it must be something that is written in a way that it will not further sink your thinking into the negative. Your affirmation must also be present tense—it needs to address something in the here and now in order to help you in the present. For example, if you are afraid of dogs, you need to make sure that your affirmation addresses that you are safe right at that minute when you are reciting your affirmation. In ensuring that you know this, you are able to recognize that the affirmation is true without denying it on some sort of grammatical technicality. Finally, your affirmation must be personal. When your affirmation sari personal, you can make them come true. When they are not personal, however, and they are actively about other people, such s telling yourself that your friends or family members love you, you can begin to doubt that. That is not to say that your friends and family do not love you, but rather, you have no way to verify the mind of someone else, and in the moments of doubt, when your mind is already lying to you, that would be an easy topic to lie about. You would be able o tell yourself that no, you do not believe that your friend loves you because you cannot prove it, and suddenly, your perfectly crafted affirmation falls apart. When you would like to use affirmations, you must simply make sure that your statement lives up to those three requirements. If it does, you are ready to move on to the next step—using your affirmation. When you are ready to use the affirmation, you must make sure ultimately that you repeat the affirmation regularly. It is a common form of manipulation to effectively insert thoughts into the mind of another with ease, with the only requirement being that you need to repeat it so much that it becomes the truth. This means that if you actively repeat the same positive message to yourself over and over again, you should be able to convince yourself to sort of absorb the knowledge to use it. The best way to do this is to pair your affirmation with an activity that you are already doing regularly. Perhaps you decide to repeat whatever your affirmation si every single time that you wash your hands. After all, you likely wash your hands on a regular basis throughout the day and you need to make use of that. When you wash your hands, you must then repeat that affirmation to yourself at least ten times. Every time you wash your hands, you then repeat that affirmation. Over the days, weeks, and months, you find that you are constantly repeating it to yourself and over time, it becomes reflexive. Every time that you wash your hands, your affirmation is repeated to yourself out of habit, despite not thinking about it. That is when it really begins to work—it has infiltrated your unconscious mind and will then begin to act accordingly. On top of the repetition in order to internalize everything, you must also make it a point to use your affirmation during moments of weakness. If you find that you are afraid of a dog, you recite it to yourself in order to remind yourself that the fear that you have is unwarranted or unnecessary. Over time, you do begin to believe it. Graded Exposure Graded exposure refers to essentially what is commonly known as exposure therapy. In graded exposure, you are making it a point to slowly expose yourself to whatever it is that you are afraid of in hopes of slowly removing the fear that you have. You do this through incremental increases in your exposure to the item or stimulus, getting closer and closer to the stimulus over time. For example, you start out by looking at photographs of big dogs playing outside to start. As you go through graded exposure, you are going to slowly acclimate to each exposure level, and in doing so, you will eventually be able to tolerate that level of exposure. Every time that you find that you can tolerate the exposure, it is time to up the increment to the next level, allowing you to then push your limits and continue to become more and more comfortable. For example, you start with those photographs of dogs. You are to view them regularly until the simple sight of a dog is not enough to send your heart racing. Then, you must move on to looking at videos of dogs. This should bring back more of your anxiety as it is slightly more realistic than actively looking at a photograph. In looking at the videos, over time, you will find that you are able to comfortably tolerate it. You are then ready to move up another level. You may then choose to hold a stuffed animal dog in order to sort of expose yourself further to the stimulus. Doing should still be uncomfortable for you, but the more you go through this process, the more smoothly you will find each of the stages to be. After the plush dog, you then move on to seeing actual dogs in action. Perhaps you stand on the other side of a fence from a small dog that is calm and well behaved so you know it will not be charging at you in an attempt to get you to do something or to harass you. After a while, you are able to move on to actually approach the dog, and eventually, you may even find that you are comfortable petting it. From there, it may just be a matter of exposing yourself to larger and larger dogs, slowly working your way up to having a dog that is quite large in your presence without the triggering of your anxiety symptoms. If you do this the right way, you will eventually find that you can, at the very least, tolerate the presence of a dog. You may never be fully comfortable around the dogs in your life, but that is okay. What is important is ensuring that you are not living your life in hiding because you are terrified of being around other people’s pets. Ultimately, whether you like it or not, dogs are incredibly common and you must be able to put up with their presence in the real world. When you use graded exposure, you are effectively teaching yourself that it is okay to be afraid, so long as you can be comfortable in your fear. Usually, graded exposure is used in tandem with other techniques such as grounding in order to add a level of security. With techniques such as grounding, you will find that you are able to better cope with all of the negativity that otherwise threatens to overwhelm you. In being able to cope with the negativity, you will find that you can actually combat and counter your phobias through this technique. What If Roleplays Finally, the last technique for mastering anxiety involves figuring out what the worst case scenario in a situation actually is. From there, you must role play it out in order to figure out if it is actually as bad as you may initially be convinced. For example, imagine that your anxiety surrounds ordering drinks at the café. You know that you need the drink, but you are too shy to order, fearing that other people will judge your taste in drink. Because of this, you tend to avoid cafes altogether, despite having a massive caffeine addiction. When you use a what if roleplay, though, you are effectively asking yourself probing questions that are designed to identify whether you can actually trust your judgment. You may be thoroughly convinced that the idea of ordering a coffee is the worst thing possible because you just know that you will mess up their special schema of how they size the drinks and everyone will laugh at you. Effectively, your anxiety tells you that you cannot possibly order a drink because it will flare up your social anxiety. It is then your job to ask yourself what the worst case scenario is. You would likely identify the act of everyone laughing at you as the worst case scenario and then move on to say that everyone around you only wants to use you for entertainment. Now, in trying to figure out what if, you must now ask yourself what that would matter. Does it matter why the people may laugh? Does being laughed at really matter? Ultimately, no, not really. While being laughed at is distressing, it is not distressing enough to warrant rearranging your entire life to accommodate for it. In this instance, then, you find that you are far better off moving forward with desensitizing yourself. Chapter 9: Depression Along with anxiety, depression can be a debilitating mental health issue. Commonly known as major depressive disorder, depression tends to encompass the feelings of hopelessness and despair that would otherwise go along with the feelings of inadequacy that an individual may be suffering from. Imagine that, no matter how comfortable your current home, job, or life, you cannot feel any joy. You find that the day is largely meaningless to you and that the night is not much better. You know that you should have energy, but all you want to do is spend your time lying in bed and refusing to do anything at all. You are far happier just left to your own devices in bed without doing anything. Depression is harmful. It causes people to struggle with motivation as well as finding hope and joy in life to continue moving forward. When you feel depressed, you struggle with anything and everything to do with other people and with yourself. Most people tend to think that depression is one of those willpower things—all you need to do is pick yourself up by your bootstraps and continue on. However, remember, the root of being able to pick yourself up from your bootstraps was meant to mock an impossibility. Just as you cannot literally pick yourself up from your bootstraps, you cannot just will yourself out of depression. What is Depression? Depression is an intense sadness, with feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness. It is characterized by at least five symptoms within a two week period of time. These symptoms are primarily a lack of energy, such as being depressed during the day, especially in the morning, or feeling like you lack energy. Other symptoms relate to how you feel about yourself— when you are depressed, you tend to feel like you are worthless or guilty regularly. It also had several physical aspects as well—you may struggle to sleep regularly, or you feel like you sleep too much, or you feel like you are slow and sluggish, or you start to see changes in your weight. There are also aspects such as suddenly having a frequent thought about death or even suicide. Ultimately, several of these symptoms come together when diagnosing depression, and they are incredibly problematic. These symptoms leave you feeling restless and like life is no longer enjoyable. You may find that you are suffering from several physical symptoms, such as being uncomfortable in your body, having headaches, struggling with digestion, or generally just hurting. You may find that things that once brought you joy, such as hobbies, enjoyable food, and sex are no longer of any interest to you, and you would much rather withdraw from the world rather than facing anyone head on. This is problematic. When you are able to fall into depression, your quality of life plummets and you are at an increased risk of thoughts of self harm or suicide, both of which are incredibly dangerous. In fact, because self harm thoughts are so common with depression, you must be ready to recognize it for what it is—a medical emergency. Any time that you feel like you may be a danger to yourself or other people, you should always contact emergency services to ensure that you get the care that you need to survive and thrive. Keep in mind that depression, while it is valid, is different than sadness or grief. It is possible for sadness or grief to eventually turn into depression, but noting that difference early on is critical. You must be able to recognize that oftentimes, depression begins with the arrival of a negative event of some sort. You may have lost a family member or gone through a messy divorce. In response, it is normal for you to feel sadness. In fact, sadness and grief are entirely normal human emotions. However, it is not normal for grief and sadness to be entirely consuming. At some point, grief transforms from something normal into something that is directly hindering your ability to function in the world around you. You may have lost someone dear to your heart, and that can be incredibly crippling, but you must not lose your ability to function in society as well. While grief does not follow a timeline that determines a normal amount of time to heal and a normal diagnosis for depression, it does become problematic when, even a month or two later, your mood is still so poorly impacted that you struggle to interact with those around you. Instead, you find yourself withdrawing and refusing to engage, and that can be incredibly problematic. If you find that your grief seems to be changing into something all consuming instead of something that is meant to be part of your healing process from a point of negativity into positivity, it is time to speak to a professional. Help is out there if you are willing and ready to reach out a hand. Remember, even if you are suffering from depression, it can and will get better. There are plenty of treatment options for people suffering from depression, from medical to therapeutic, to even making lifestyle changes. If you work closely in tandem with a doctor or other medical professional that is familiar with you and your case, you will find that you are able to get the relief that you need from your depression. It may take you time to develop, such as waiting for the medication to build up enough to help, or to make sure that you actively have enough therapeutic skills to actually make use of, but you will see improvements in your life, little by little. Types of Depression Depression is not a one size fits all diagnosis. In fact, there are several different depressive disorders that exist, and understanding the different ones is critical to recognize what is going on in your life and ensuring that you are able to treat yourself. In particular, let’s take a look at unipolar major depression, dysthymia, and postpartum depression to get a better understanding of how depression can and does present, and what can be expected from it. Unipolar Ms ostpartum y nipolar Major pysthivinia Postpar tum Depression Souci! Depression e Defined by e Persistent (at e Happens after major episodes of least 2 years) childbirth deep depression e Mild, but nearly ə Believedto be and a lack of constant you relatedta energy or suffer from fluctuation of motivation depressive hormones * Can be symptoms more intermittent or oft enthan not constant Unipolar Major Depression This is the form of depression that most people think of—it is the depression that is heavy and overreaching, clouding over everything in your life. It may last for a shorter period of time, such as a few weeks to months, or it can happen intermittently in life. You may have periods of calm, during which you do not have very many symptoms, but you will also commonly find that you run into having several symptoms all at once, making it major. Dysthymia Dysthymia refers to mild, persistent depression that lasts for years. It is always overshadowing your life but generally presents itself in manners that are far less harmful than unipolar major depression. Still problematic for sure, it is not something that you should overlook, but generally, it is considered less severe. When you live life with dysthymia, you are chronically mildly depressed. Anything that you do or say will constantly be shadowed over by your depression, and while you may not be majorly depressed or suicidal on the regular, you are likely to still feel quite down on yourself, low on energy, and unwilling to get moving on a regular basis. Postpartum Depression Believed to be brought on due to the influx of hormones that women go through right after giving birth, postpartum depression is incredibly common. In fact, it has become a regular part of screening at women’s postpartum exams precisely because people tend to develop it and it is easier to ensure that you are screening everyone early on rather than waiting to see how other people report their feelings. Unfortunately for the women that suffer from PPD, what should be the best time of their lives, welcoming their newest bundle of joy, becomes overshadowed with low emotions, sadness, inadequacy, and feelings of hopelessness that can be overwhelming. Postpartum depression is commonly treated with medication and therapy during the postpartum period, but this form of depression usually goes away before the infant born during this birth leaves infancy. Depression and CBT Depression is commonly treated with CBT. Because much of depression does exhibit itself in a behavioral manner, it is quite possible to effectively create good habits that can and will motivate an individual into successful functioning. While this will not eliminate the negative feelings per se, it can act as a way to bridge the gap, allowing the individual to begin acting in a better adjusted manner. Through behavioral activation, new habits can be developed and learned. These get the individual back into a routine, and with the development and enforcement of the routines, it becomes clear that the habituating to action once more can really help allow for that initial push over the lack of motivation. That is critical in ensuring the actual activation of new habits. Depression is also commonly coped with in figuring out if there are any negative thoughts that are holding the individual down. It is possible for someone with depression to think about himself in manners that are incredibly negative. This, of course, does nothing to help the individual do any better. It is incredibly difficult to feel good about yourself if you are actively telling yourself that you are a terrible, worthless person and then acting upon those thoughts, and for that reason, CBT seeks to identify and defeat any of those negative thoughts before they can truly corrupt the individual’s mind. In correcting these mindsets, it is possible that the individual can start to see some improvement in their own mentality as they progress through CBT. They can develop more and more skills that enable the individual to cope better with issues that arise. They can help the individual begin to reacquaint himself with these actions that are critical to success. If you feel like you are suffering from depression, one of the best things that you can do for yourself is make an appointment with your primary care physician to identify whether you may actually be suffering from the impacts of depression. If you are, there are ways that you can begin to help yourself, and doing so will help bring joy to your life once more. Chapter 10: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Techniques to Eliminate Depression With that said, it is time to address three of the most common cognitive behavioral therapy techniques that you can use in order to directly begin to alleviate your symptoms of depression. Please remember, if you are currently taking any medication for depression, do not stop suddenly and do not change the regimen of your medication until you have spoken to your doctor about your proposed changes. Changing medication can be incredibly finicky, especially if you have already discovered several methods that are working for you, and you deciding to change that routine that you already have can to more harm than good. Nevertheless, within this chapter, we will address three techniques that are used in treating depression within cognitive behavioral therapy. We are specifically addressing successive approximation, goal setting, and activity scheduling. Remember, while many aspects of CBT focus on changing thought processes, what is often the most effective for those suffering from depression is to use techniques that specifically target behaviors. If you can directly challenge those behaviors, you can begin to better cope with the situations at hand. You can essentially take advantage of the fact that people are creatures of habit and that your body will naturally want to shift into a series of habits that you are actively making use of. Successive Approximation The first method that will be discussed is known as a successive approximation. It is quite similar to the act of exposure therapy. However, the primary difference is that instead of being designed to create tolerance of a specific stimulus you are trying to create and trigger specific behaviors in someone else. You effectively want to make sure that you are building up to a certain behavior while also rewarding yourself for the successes that you do have. Effectively, this will involve you starting out with a goal. With that goal in mind, you break it up into several manageable steps. For example, say that you want to be able to run 3 miles without feeling like you are dying. You may start with a goal of running % a mile without stopping. You work on this, and every time that you succeed, you give yourself a treat. That treat should be something that is incredibly motivating for you—perhaps you promise yourself that if you can run the mile, you can spend some time actively playing on some video games that you have and that if you get to the 3 mile goal, you will buy that new game that is coming out soon. That week, every time you run % mile, you reward yourself. Eventually, you will find that your body is adjusting. Running that % mile no longer seems so intimidating or impossible, and that is when you know that you are moving your goalpost further toward your goal. Now, you must run 34 mile before you are willing to give in to your reward. Eventually, that becomes easier as well, and you will continue to shift your goal until you finally do achieve the 3 mile limit that you have set for yourself. Upon arriving at that 3 mile goal, you reward yourself with that game. The entire purpose behind successive approximation is to get yourself moving in the right direction. This is like rewarding your new puppy when she approaches her new leash on the floor when you are trying to accustom her to it, and you slowly move the milestone until she is happily prancing about next to you on the leash. Yes, this means that you are effectively training yourself into obedience—but if it is good enough for most animals, why not for humans as well? Besides, it cannot be that bad if you are actively training yourself. You are simply relying on several of the tactics that are commonly recognized by the behaviorist perspective in psychology and that is not necessarily wrong or problematic—you are making sure that you are bettering yourself. Goal Setting When you are able to set good goals, you may find that your goals suddenly become a whole lot more attainable. Setting goals, then, is not as simple as just saying that you are going to do something and then making it a point to do so. For example, you cannot say that you are simply going to get a job paying $100,000 a year without ever coming up with a goal that spells out exactly how you would achieve that in the first place. It is imperative that you are able to figure out exactly why and how you will do something beyond just stating that you will do something; otherwise, it becomes incredibly difficult to actually find the motivation to stick to your guns and follow through. Perhaps one of the easiest ways to set goals that are actionable and can be achieved is the use of SMART goals. Standing for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Timed, these are goals that are specifically designed in a way that takes out the vast majority of your planning. After all, little can be as intimidating as having to come up with a solid action plan when you are trying to achieve something. Having a plan that you feel is not quite secure or proper is not always the most motivating way to set your goal, and for that reason, we will take a look at SMART goals. When you set a SMART goal, you are looking to set a goal that meets each and every one of the checkboxes next to specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and timely. This means that you may need to put a bit of thought into how you will achieve your goal, but if you play your cards right, you can do so in a way that is beneficial to everyone involved. Specific goals are exactly what they sound like—goals with a well defined purpose. You know exactly what you are doing when you set a goal to be specific. For example, imagine that you are actively trying to run more often. You may say, “I want to run,” as your goal, but is that very specific? It does not tell you much more about your goal other than you simply want to make sure that you are running at some point. However, it does not tell you much about ever actually achieving that goal of running. When you make it more specific, though, you say, “I want to be able to run 3 miles straight without stopping.” Now, you have an ending point—you know where your goal wraps up and you know that you should be able to make it happen. Measurable goals are goals that have some defined ending. They usually exist in some manner that you can measure to check your progress. In this instance, your goal of running three miles already included a measurable aspect—you have set it up in the distance that you would like to run. Sometimes, however, it is not quite so clear cut. If you want to stop being angry, for example, you may need to set a goal so you are eliminating a certain portion of blowouts per day or some other way to shift your goal from something relatively vague into something measured. However, by and large, you will find that most of your goals will become measured by the nature of setting the goal in the first place. Achievable goals are goals that are actually possible for you to achieve. It does not matter so much here whether you want to achieve the goal but rather looking at your own capabilities. Do you want to climb Mt. Everest? Do all of your body parts work properly? If you have a problem with an ankle or your back, for example, you may want to overlook the idea of going on that trip to climb the mountain because it is not actually as achievable as you may like. Relevant goals are goals that you actually care about. These goals are the ones that truly matter to you for some reason. A common way to check whether your goal is relevant or not is through asking yourself if you actually want to achieve whatever it is that you are setting out to do. If you are entirely uninterested in the goal, then it is likely not very relevant to you. For example, if you already run 6 miles a morning, running a 3 mile morning does not seem like a stretch or an accomplishment—all because they are in her norm. Timed goals are goals that have an end somewhere. They have some sort of cut off that determines whether or not you were actually successful in achieving your goal. For example, you may give yourself two months of practice to be able to run that three mile track, and if you do not do it by that two month mark, then you forfeit the challenge and prove that you cannot do it. When you have reached the end of the timeline that you have set out to achieve, you need to be able to determine whether or not you were actually successful. In following these steps, you will find that your goals are actually far more reachable. It becomes far easier to actually achieve your goals when you know how to structure them for success. Effectively, then, you are setting up so you know that you are able to approach a situation in a manner that enables you to be far more successful in your life. It may be a pain to work on your goals initially, but you will find that doing so is imperative to your ability to actively work on what you are trying to work on. Activity Scheduling Finally, activity scheduling refers to the art of intentionally scheduling activities throughout your day to do. You may, for example, decide to continue working on being able to run those three miles. In this case, you would actively schedule in time to work on your running at the regiment that you have set up for yourself. You will effectively be doing your best to schedule those activities in and meet them. When you do meet your activities that are scheduled for the day, you will then be able to use any of the extra time that was not used up to achieve your goal for the day to do something that you enjoy. This method is quite similar to the method of successive approximation, but in this case, you are rewarding your progress toward achieving a goal. You are ensuring that other people are likely to want to follow your lead because, as you begin to use this, you find that being organized is actually far easier than you may think it will be otherwise. To do this, all you must do is come up with some sort of schedule and follow it. If you can do so, you are pushing yourself to develop good time management skills, and that will also help you bolster your own emotional intelligence as well. Chapter 11: Insomnia Despite the fact that children everywhere hate the idea of sleep and reject the idea of taking naps whenever the option is presented, adults all around the world wish they could go back to those days where sleep was not a limited commodity. With how busy the world is, how several aspects of life are now 24/7, and how much work gets crammed into such short periods of time, people everywhere find that they are not getting enough sleep. However, what about the people who, despite how much they may wish to sleep, cannot manage to do so? These people may desperately want to fall asleep, spending plenty of time in their beds as they toss and turn, wishing for sleep to take over, but it never comes. These people suffer from insomnia. No one ever wants to be on the receiving end of insomnia, but when it strikes, it can be incredibly frustrating. When you are desperate to be able to get a few extra hours of sleep, lying in bed without any luck can be one of the greatest slights of the universe. What is Insomnia? Insomnia is a sleep disorder—this means that it is characterized primarily by disordered sleep patterns that cause significant issues to the individual suffering from it. When you suffer from insomnia, you may either struggle to fall asleep, or you may struggle to stay asleep. This means that either way, you are missing out on incredibly valuable sleep. After all, the average adult needs at least 8 hours of sleep a night to remain functional. When you do not get that sleep, you run the risk of all sorts of health issues, as well as the risk of falling asleep intermittently throughout the day. In fact, you may even fall asleep at the wheel in your car, which can be incredibly dangerous, not only for you but for everyone around you as well. When you fall asleep at the wheel, you can cause fatal car accidents for everyone involved. Ultimately, insomnia can be summed up as four symptoms, with at least one needing to be present in order to warrant a diagnosis of insomnia. These symptoms are struggling to fall asleep, struggling to stay asleep at night, waking up too early, or feeling tired, even after sleeping. With these symptoms, you will find that you are constantly exhausted and dragging, and no matter how hard you try, you struggle to function. People are not designed to function without sleep—in fact, losing even just four hours of sleep in a night can have the same impact on you as having a beer before driving. You need to be getting proper sleep if you want to be properly functional, but for those with insomnia, that is an impossibility. Forms of Insomnia Ultimately, there are two distinct forms of insomnia—primary and secondary. These are determined quite simply. Primary insomnia refers to people that are struggling to sleep without any associated physical cause. Effectively, nothing physical seems to point toward the reason for the lack of sleep. Secondary insomnia, on the other hand, is typically caused by something else. It can be caused by physical ailments, such as a physical issue like cancer or arthritis making it impossible to sleep. The difference between the two is primarily whether insomnia is the problem or a symptom of a larger problem. When insomnia is the problem, insomnia itself can be treated. However, when the insomnia is a symptom of another problem, sometimes the best course of action is to treat the symptom. Insomnia can further be classified into either acute or chronic insomnia based upon how long it has lasted. When you are suffering from acute insomnia, you have had it short term. Effectively, it lasts for anywhere from one night to a couple of weeks. However, it quickly becomes chronic, or long lasting, when it is recurring for at least half of the week for longer than a month. Causes of Insomnia In understanding the causes of insomnia, you can begin to understand how best to treat it. If there is an environmental cause of insomnia, for example, you can treat the environment to best figure out how to fix the problem. If the problem is behavioral, you can change those. If the problem is due to medication, those can be changed as well. Effectively, there is usually some sort of cause to the insomnia that people feel—it is simply a matter of figuring out what that cause is so it can be addressed somehow. Acute insomnia is usually caused by something short term and environmental. For example, a significant stressor can cause insomnia—a trauma, a loss, moving, or anything else that drastically uproots your entire life can then lead to insomnia. The discomfort of being sick can also lead to short term insomnia, especially if you are suffering from being unable to breathe and struggling to avoid hacking out a lung. Other times, physical discomfort can make it impossible to sleep—perhaps you are in bed with your two toddlers and they have you jammed against the wall with your neck bent funny so you cannot possibly get comfortable enough to fall asleep. The environment can also directly impact your ability to sleep in the short term—if your neighbors are loud or your power is out so your heater is off and it is cold, you may struggle to fall asleep. Much more harmlessly, you can also see insomnia as a direct result of jet lag—just getting home from a trip to the other side of the world can cause you to suffer from insomnia. Chronic insomnia, on the other hand, is typically linked to more persistent causes. You may be suffering from chronic stress that keeps you up at night —perhaps you cannot quite make ends meet, or you are getting through a cancer diagnosis. Maybe you are depressed or anxious and find that you cannot quiet your mind enough to fall asleep. When these occur, treating the insomnia becomes a bit more difficult—you must be able to alleviate the suffering in some way. If you are stressed, you need to figure out a way to manage it. If you are in pain, you should find a way to manage that as well. Treating Insomnia Despite how tempting it may be to reach for that bottle of wine or beer before bed to help you relax enough to sleep through your insomnia, this is ill advised—firstly, treating yourself with drugs is never healthy. Secondly, all this will do is worsen the quality of the sleep that you do get. Even if you are desperate to get some much needed sleep, you are far better off looking at other methods to get it, such as figuring out how to meet with a doctor to see if you need a prescription. Generally, unless your insomnia is becoming so problematic that you are starting to struggle to function, you are better off trying to figure out how to use good sleep hygiene to help yourself get that sleep. However, if you are finding that your functioning has been impaired, you may find that you are best served by taking some temporary sleeping pills that can help you fall asleep quickly. This is generally the advice for acute insomnia. For chronic insomnia, you must first figure out what the underlying causes are. It is always possible that there is some physical reason for that insomnia to be so problematic, and if it is found to not be a physical cause, you may be referred to behavioral therapy. Insomnia and CBT In particular, CBT can be incredibly effective at teaching exercises that will aid in the falling asleep of those who otherwise would struggle. There are several techniques that can impact the behavioral side of your mind in order to trigger you to finally be able to begin falling asleep regularly again. If you have always wanted to get back into that ability to sleep again, speaking to your therapist would be a fantastic starting point. Within the next chapter as well, we will look at three different techniques common in CBT that will help treat insomnia. These teach behaviors that are designed to promote better sleep hygiene and help you fall asleep. Chapter 12: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Techniques to Eliminate Insomnia While sleep aids are always an option for those suffering from insomnia, many people prefer to avoid them. They may dislike the impact of the medication that they take, disliking that they feel groggy when they wake up, or they may find that they end up doing things that they regret the next morning, such as going on an online shopping spree for random items that they do not actually want nor need. When this happens, the individual can be quite stressed out and embarrassed—what if they spent money that they need to have refunded? What if they sent messages to other people that shouldn’t have been sent? If you feel like you would like to sleep better and more soundly but without the impact of sleep aids, there are options for you. You can instead learn how to eliminate insomnia with behavioral therapy training that can really aid you in figuring out how best to address your situation. You can learn how to be cognizant of how to get to sleep while also focusing on doing so without having to make any major dietary or medical changes to your life. In particular, this chapter seeks to introduce you to three techniques common in CBT that can help you eliminate the impact of insomnia in your life. First, you will learn about stimulus control. Then, you will take a look at sleep restriction, and finally, you will learn a relaxation training method to help you relax into sleep when you feel like you otherwise will not be able to fall asleep. With the help of these techniques, you should find that falling asleep begins to come easier than ever, allowing you to once and for all settle back into your comfortable routine and enjoy those good nights’ sleep that you have missed out on for so long. Stimulus Control When you look at the world through the behaviorist’s eyes, you are seeing things through the belief that everything that you are exposed to directly impacts what you are doing at any given point of time. Effectively, your own behaviors are constantly just reflections of your surroundings. When you are able to recognize this, you will see just how important controlling your surroundings can be to sleep. When you are struggling to sleep, the first place to check is often your sleep hygiene. What are you doing before bed? Are you using a regular schedule? Are you using caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol before going to sleep? Are you eating food that can lead to indigestion? Is your bedroom simply not conducive to sleep? When you seek to use stimulus control, you are effectively becoming incredibly strict with what you are willing to expose yourself to in the last half of the day. You may refuse to drink soda or have any sugar or caffeine after 2pm in hopes of everything that you had consumed being out of your system by the time that you are ready to sleep. You may make it a point to exercise during the day in order to help your nighttime sleep. The most effective form of stimulus control of all, however, is developing a proper sleep routine and making sure that you have a comfortable sleep environment that is designed to be conducive to sleep. In order to do this, you must first be willing to cut out all caffeine, spicy food, and blue light in the last half of the evening. Blue light comes from your screens, such as your cell phone, tablet computer, or even your television—the light can prevent you from being able to fall asleep because it directly interferes with your own body’s mechanics that are designed to help you wind down to sleep. You must make it a point to cut off all blue light at least one hour before bed and set a rule that no screens will be used in the bedroom. During that hour before bed, make sure you expose yourself to stimuli that will be relaxing. You will effectively condition yourself to fall asleep by teaching your body that those are the predecessors to bedtime, so when you begin that bedtime routine, your body will begin to produce the right hormones to help you fall asleep. You may decide to take a warm shower, read a book, and then settle down in bed in the dark, free of screens, while also making sure that your room is cool and comfortable. If you are willing to restrict the stimuli that you expose yourself to, you will find that sweet sleep coming in no time. It may take a few times to get your body on the same page, but as soon as it is, you will not be able to deny the difference—just being able to fall asleep will be a huge improvement. Sleep Restriction Sometimes, what you need to do in order to help yourself get back on schedule is what is called sleep restriction. This is exactly what it sounds like—you will restrict your ability to sleep during certain times to effectively teach yourself to sleep at night when you should be. This can be particularly draining and difficult, however, because you will have to be making it a point to staying awake even when the need to sleep threatens to overwhelm you because you need to stay awake until it is your proper bedtime. When you begin sleep restriction, you will start by limiting your time in bed to only the hours that you are currently asleep, making sure to log your sleep patterns. You are allowed to spend only those sleeping hours in bed at first. If you are only sleeping 3 or 4 hours a night, then you are only allowed to spend time in your bed during those 3 or 4 hours. From there, you must set a wake time and bedtime based upon your current sleep time. If you are only averaging 5 hours of sleep in bed and you determine that you must be awake by 6am every day, this means that you go to bed every night at lam. No matter how much sleep you have gotten, you must always get up at 6am for the next several weeks, while also going to bed at the same time. Even if you feel tired before 1am, you must stay awake until then for the training to work. You will then follow this schedule for at least two weeks. After the two weeks, you can start getting in bed 15 minutes earlier on a nightly basis until you are comfortable with how much sleep you are getting. Over time, you will find that you will either figure out how much sleep you need to get and find a nice equilibrium point between how much sleep and when you get that sleep. Relaxation Training Finally, sometimes, you cannot fall asleep no matter what you try. Within CBT, there is thankfully a type of training that you can use in order to begin relaxing in order to fall asleep. This is known as relaxation training. You will effectively be triggering to the brain that it is time to relax based upon the cues that you are sending. In manually making it a point to relax your own body, little by little, you will eventually trigger your body to also want to relax on its own and fall asleep. This will effectively override any feelings of danger that are keeping the brain on overdrive and potentially preventing you from being able to fall asleep. To begin, you will want to get yourself comfortable in bed. Make sure that you have spent an adequate amount of time following your sleep routine and making sure that you have prepared accordingly. As you get into bed, make sure that your room is dark, quiet, and suitable for sleep. Find your comfortable spot and take in a deep breath as you do so. Feel the breath travel through your lungs and fill your body with life giving oxygen. Exhale and then focus on the top of your head. Do you feel any tension? If your scalp feels tense, try to release it. If not, slowly scan down your body starting from the top. Anywhere that you find tenseness, you must manually encourage relaxation. Perhaps you find that your jaw is clenched because you are stressed. With a deep inhale, relax the jaw and allow yourself to settle down deeper into the mattress. Keep scanning your body. Every place that you notice tension, gently release it, allowing each part of your body to relax, little by little. As you work your way through your body, calming anywhere with tension, you will feel the progress. You will feel the sensation of relaxation within you. Continue to release the tension all the way down to your toes, and when it is all gone, remain motionless in bed. While you lay there, focus on your breathing. Take in a deep breath for four seconds. Hold it for a moment in your lungs before slowly exhaling as well, allowing yourself to release the air from your chest and begin to relax. Continue this process while focusing entirely on your breathing. Any time that you notice tension building again, release it and continue. You want to be as relaxed as possible. If your room is conducive to sleep, you should find that you fall asleep soon. Chapter 13: Anger Everyone feels angry from time to time. It is a normal human emotion with a very good purpose—it seeks to defend us. However, anger is also perhaps one of the most destructive emotions that people can have. It is entirely possible for people who are angry to fly into a blind rage, utterly losing control of themselves and behaving in ways that are incredibly dangerous. People have been known to eve kill during these periods of time, so incredibly blinded by their all consuming rage that they did not realize what they were doing until it was too late. Ultimately, anger is useful in moderation. If it is not in moderation, it typically errs on the side of destructive and problematic, and for that reason learning to cope and control your anger is one of the best skills that you can learn if you hope to be a positive influence that is capable of interacting with other people, no matter what the capacity. Within this chapter, we will address anger as an emotion—we will look at its purpose and why it is commonly triggered. We will also take the time to understand what happens when anger becomes problematic and the signs that you or someone you know may have an anger management problem. What is Anger? Nearly everyone feels anger at some point—that boiling, white hot fire in the chest and the sudden need to fight back. Anger itself is one of the primary emotions that humans have—it is an emotion that is rooted entirely in protection. When you are angry, you are going to behave aggressively, and for a good reason. Do you remember the discussion of emotions as motivators for various functions to aid in survival? Anger is one such emotion, and it is one of the most powerful of them all. Anger is primarily defined as feeling negatively toward someone or something that you have perceived has wronged you in some way. It is essentially your way to protect and enforce your own boundaries to ensure that people do not take advantage of you. In moderation, it does exactly that —it can be a proper alarm bell to key you in to the fact that you are being taken advantage of or otherwise used. You will be able to tell that something is not quite right if it brings you to anger without you having to do a thing. You simply feel infuriated. If you do not know what the problem is, it is time to do some close introspection to figure out what is going on. As a primary emotion to help ensure survival, your anger is critical to protecting you in certain situations. In fact, you are likely to be angry if you feel like your needs are not being met in some way. If you are hungry, you are more likely to snap, or if you feel like you are threatened, you may feel that inclination to snap at other people. Ultimately, however, every person deals with anger in a different manner. Some people are incredibly patient to a fault—no matter what happens to them, they are able to remain calm and level headed. In particular, this is a skill set that is strongly valued in emotional intelligence—the ability to self regulate is critical if you want to be able to manage yourself and other people, after all. Other people, on the other hand, find themselves enslaved by their anger, always giving in to whatever impulses they have. This can be incredibly problematic, as we will discuss shortly. Anger and Motivation Anger is a form of motivation—it motivates us to protect. Effectively, when you are angry, you recognize that there is something threatening about your situation and you seek to fight it. You know that you are facing some sort of injustice or threat—perhaps someone took advantage of you and ran away with your belongings. Maybe you were trusting your best friend to help you with something, only for your friend to cancel on you again. You feel like you are betrayed, and that sense of betrayal leads to anger. Anger is effectively your fight response—if you feel the impulses of anger, it is usually because you are angry at someone or something and you are trying to figure out who or why. Your anger, when it is expressed, is usually in body language. When you are angry, you will look the part—you will stare threateningly and you will not likely back down if challenged. Effectively, you are preparing for a fight and you expect the other person that is threatening you to as well. While anger may have initially been a basic instinct to help protect oneself and family, it has become more. We are no longer threatened on the regular with a need to fight to the death, but the feeling of anger when we are feeling betrayed is just as strong as ever. When you are prone to anger, you may find that you have several common triggers that you cannot escape. Even if you know that your anger or frustration is illogical or unwarranted, you cannot help but feel angry. Some of these causes can range from feeling grief and sadness after losing someone to feeling like someone around you has done something that is less than respectful. Of course, anger can also arise due to stress, a lack of control, or even unmet physical needs. Needs like the need for food, sex, or water can lead to anger and short tempers within people, leading to them being far more likely to lash out at other than they otherwise would be. It is important to recognize that people can feel angry for a wide range of reasons, and if you find that you have angered someone, it may be worth the effort to figure out where the communication disconnect is. If you cannot identify the disconnect, you may need to instead focus on how best to step back from the situation until the other party can calm down. Especially if you or the other person is known to have an anger problem, it may be smart to engage in all conversations when everyone’s anger has subsided. When Anger Becomes Problematic Ultimately, like with most areas in life, anger becomes a problem when you are no longer able to control it. If you find that your anger causes you to say or do things that you regret, you may find that you have an anger problem. Unfortunately, uncontrolled anger s surprisingly common, and it is also surprisingly unhealthy, both physically and emotionally. When you are angry, your body automatically gears up for a fight due to the fact that anger is the primary emotion behind the fight response. This means that your breathing increases, your sensation of pain goes down, and your heart rate and blood pressure skyrocket. You effectively prepare to fight to the death, even though what you may be upset about is actually completely trivial at best. You may be getting all worked up over a joke, for example, or the fact that someone else got to the parking spot you had been eyeing while waiting for a woman and her children to cross the road. Ultimately, if you want to determine if you have anger issues yourself, you may want to focus on some serious self reflection with the following questions to consider in mind: e Do you often feel like you are angry? e Is your anger often out of control, despite your best attempts to manage it? e Do you think that your anger is hurting your relationships with other people? e Do you find that your anger causes you to hurt other people? e Do you regret what you do when you are angry once you calm down? e Do you have a tendency to hurt other people, physically or emotionally, when you are angry? Answering yes to any of those questions can be incredibly telling that there is, in fact, some sort of anger issue going on in your life. As devastating of a realization as that may be, it also means that you can figure out how best to address the world around you from then on. If you know that you struggle with your anger, you can begin to treat it and work on techniques that you can use to help eliminate that struggle. Chapter 14: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Techniques to Eliminate Anger Issues Once you have identified that you may be struggling with your anger, it is time for you to begin understanding what comes next. In particular, you may be wondering how best you can cope with those feelings of anger as they arise? What can you possibly do to help the situation around you? How can you prevent your anger from getting worse when you do feel it? Because oftentimes, when people are angry, they are not thinking clearly, it becomes critical to figure out how best to address the situation when you are calm. If you can put together a plan to help you manage your anger when you are calm, you will often find that following that plan gets infinitely easier when you are in a situation that calls for it. In particular, this chapter will introduce you to three methods common in CBT to helping manage anger issues that may arise. Remember that ultimately, the method that you use to control your anger is your own—all you need to do is find the one that works best for you. The best anger management is the anger management that does its job well. Also, remember that just because you still feel angry sometimes even with the implementation of these tools does not mean that they are not working. Keep in mind that anger is a very real, very normal emotion and you should consider the fact that it is normal for people to feel. You do not need to be ashamed of feeling anger—what matters is that you know how best to control it to avoid running into any issues later. the three techniques that you will be addressing within this chapter are anger disruption, cognitive change, and an attitude change with an emphasis on forgiveness and acceptance over the situation at hand. Anger Disruption When you are angry, you usually struggle to recognize it in the moment. Sure, you may be aware of the sensation, but you are rarely cognitively able to remind yourself, “Hey, I’m feeling angry—lI better not do that right now!” Instead, you find yourself swayed by the need to continue with the yelling and the demanding despite knowing that it is not the best possible way to move forward. If this sounds like you, you are not alone. This is why many people take advantage of anger disruption. Anger disruption is the ability to effectively interrupt your anger in some way, shape, or form. Usually, this is done by removing yourself from the situation and avoiding the stimulus that is frustrating to you at that moment. Some people may call this running away, but keep in mind that choosing to temporarily remove yourself in order to calm down is not cowardly or running away—it is choosing to avoid escalation. It can be good to discuss this technique with those that you are close to beforehand so they know what you are doing in the heat of the moment. After all, if you are angry, it is quite likely that they are also frustrated to some degree and they may want their own sort of resolution to the situation. There are several different ways that you can manage this technique. For example, you can avoid the distressing stimulus altogether. If you are fighting with your spouse, walk into another room and pick up something else to do. Perhaps you choose to fold some laundry or do the dishes—you chose something neutral to do while you wait for the feeling to pass. You may also have an internal method to remove yourself emotionally from the situation, such as telling yourself that you will always take a deep breath and count to ten before responding when you are angry. Yes, this may draw out some conversations, but it will allow you to weigh your options and what you are saying well before you say it. Keep in mind that while removal is a great way to manage your emotions in the moment, it does nothing to fix the problem or help you gain more self control over yourself in the future. You may still be just as readily angered as you have not done any work on what has been angering you at that point in time. This is very rarely a strategy that can be used alone—it must be used in tandem with other aspects, such as cognitive restructuring in order to come up with some sort of method of addressing those negative feelings that you have. In addressing those negative feelings, you may find that you are actually able to protect yourself further. Cognitive Change Sometimes, the best thing that you can do when you are angry is find a way to manage and shift your mindset away from anger and onto something that is far more productive and useful to you. For example, if you are angry, you are going to be so caught up on what is and is not fair that you are not likely to think very clearly when you are being walked through why you did not get the result you were looking for on something. Maybe you are angry because the store was sold out of the specific item you wanted after you Saw someone else walking away with that particular item that you had set out to buy. When you get upset by a situation like this, it can be incredibly easy to find yourself caught up in the fact that things went wrong. Instead of seeing that you were simply unlucky, you somehow turn it into some sort of grievous insult against you—you were intentionally left out of getting that item and that it must have been your bad luck again. You may even go so far as to insult the person who bought the last of the item because you are being driven by your anger and feel the need to scream and yell your frustrations. Your mind is caught in the loop of negativity, and you need to figure out how to best push your mind out of that angry, negative perspective toward a perspective that is far more rational and calmer. One such way to change your cognitive state is to use silly humor in some way. You may not laugh initially, as no one enjoys laughing at themselves or making themselves feel dumb or silly. However, this type of cognitive change seeks to make the situation humorous in some way, shape, or form in order to sort of shock the mind out of that angry state of mind and into one that will be able to handle the situation better. For example, imagine that you are frustrated over not getting that last item at the store. Under your breath, you mutter that the person is a selfish pig as you walk away in frustration. The other person must have heard you because she turns around shrugs, and says that her name is, in fact, Portia, which means pig, and she is quite happy to keep her item, thank you very much. The absurdity of the situation gives you pause as you realize the irony of it, and the sudden shock is enough to help you shift from that moment of toxic anger into one that is mildly amused by the way the universe played that situation out. In the end, you apologize for calling the lady a pig and go on your way. Acceptance and Forgiveness Finally, let’s talk about both acceptance and forgiveness. Stop and think for a moment about what it is that makes people angry. Usually, either it is some sort of inconvenience, or it is because they are causing some sort of problem for you some other way. When you learn to accept the situation for what it is and move on, however, you may find that the anger melts away almost effortlessly. For example, imagine that your child ran through the family room with a glass of milk, something that is against the rules of your home, and spilled milk all over the carpet and sofa. However, instead of telling anyone, he snuck away and pretended like it never happened—until the smell of rotting milk was a dead giveaway. You may immediately feel angry—you now have yet another mess that you have to clean up that you would much rather not deal with. You are frustrated at your child for not listening and wishing that they would have listened to you all along, or at the very least, that they would not have hidden what they were doing from you. They could have asked for help to clean up the mess before it had a chance to fester. One way that you can stop that anger, however, is to stop, remind yourself that it was not intentional, and move on. You are basically accepting what has happened for what it is—an unintentional accident that was handled poorly and moving on. You are effectively moving away from the idea that your child had intentionally ignored your rules or dumped the milk to spite you, which you may have initially felt. Instead, you focus on the accident and move on. When you do this, you effectively put an emphasis on understanding the other person’s perspective. They may have done something that triggered your anger, but why did they do what they did? If you are able to stop and consider things from their perspectives instead of from your own, you may find that you are actually far more likely to accept and put up with it. You are more capable of moving forward simply because you are able to recognize the other side and show some compassion that you may hope would be shown to you if you had made a mistake as well. When you use acceptance and forgiveness, then you simply let go of those feelings of anger and frustration. You know that what has happened has happened and effectively let go of the temptation to dwell on the past. Chapter 15: Social Skills Finally, we have arrived at the last chapter of the book! Within this chapter, it is time to address several social skills that people have. As both CBT and emotional intelligence seek to help you become a well rounded individual that is capable of handling nearly anything, it is important to stop and recognize the importance of some of the most basic social skills that you may need. When you master these social skills of mirroring, empathizing, making good eye contact, listening actively, and learning to analyze other people, you will find that your own abilities to be emotionally intelligent will increase dramatically. Effectively, you will be able to manage yourself and those around you. Imagine how much easier communicating with other people would be if you could understand their body language or if you acknowledged their own feelings at the moment? How much easier would it be to relate to people if you knew what to look for to know that they are interested in you? What if you are able to listen actively in order to better understand those around you? Mirroring The first technique that we will look at was drawn from neuro linguistic programming but has become incredibly popular. This is the skill of mirroring—when you can mirror someone else, you are effectively able to make sure that you and the other person have a working connection with each other. Commonly used to make yourself more relatable or more persuasive, using mirroring allows you to actively relate to the other person through tapping into the other person’s unconscious mind in order to convince them to be willing to interact with you. When you are mirroring someone else, you are acting upon the idea that the closer two people are to each other, the more in tune they are with each other. They typically mimic each other’s movements without even realizing it—they will actively follow the lead of each other in their conversations and even in their body language. If one crosses their arms, so will the other. If one takes a drink, the other one will, too. Effectively, then, you can tell how close people are in general by looking at how similarly and in sync they move. However, you can also trigger this in other people—you can effectively convince them to follow your lead in order to reap all of the benefits of them actively feeling like they can trust you. Think of when this could be useful—particularly if you want to be persuasive with emotional intelligence, you need to be able to prove that you are trustworthy. This is one such way to do so. To mirror other people, you will follow three key steps—you will make sure that you feel some sort of connection to the other person, you will match their pace somehow, and then you will identify their punctuator. In learning these, you will be able to convince even strangers that you hardly know that you and they are closer than either of you actually are. This is an incredibly important social skill—you can use it to facilitate a relationship that you feel is not properly developing quickly enough, for example. Make a Match the connection pace When you go to make a connection, you effectively want to figure out how best to present yourself in the situation to make yourself seem like you are actively listening. Of course, you will be actively listening, but you really want to emphasize it for the other person. You do this by facing the other person, making solid eye contact, and nodding your head as you listen. As you do this, you should feel the makings of the beginning of a relationship. You can continue through matching the pace of the other person—you effectively want to pick up on the other person’s enthusiasm and speech patterns. If they are speaking rapidly, you, too, should speak rapidly. If they are calm, you should approach the situation calmly as well. In doing this for a while, you should find that they also are matching your own speaking pace as well. Finally, you must figure out what the other party’s punctuator is—this is how they really emphasize what they are saying at any given moment. Most commonly, you see this in people who may punch the air or make a certain hand gesture, such as chopping on their palm when they really want to emphasize that point they are making. Upon identifying it, you must then figure out when they are going to use it next—and then beat them to it. You want to use the punctuator before they do in order to make sure that you actively are able to trigger that mirroring connection. From there, all you need to do is test if you were successful. If you were, you will find that they will unconsciously mirror your own subtle movements as well. Empathizing While empathizing does not come naturally to everyone, it is critical to know how to do it. Many people will find that they naturally empathize with others without trying to, but if you are not in that lucky group that learns to empathize without much effort, you may find that you need to make it a point to learn. Remember, empathy is critical to your own ability to relate to other people. If you cannot naturally empathize, you must figure out how to cognitively empathize so you can, at the very least, understand other people and their emotions as well. When you want to begin, you will start quite simply—imagine yourself in the other person’s shoes. If you are annoyed that your friend is irritated that you were late to something, perhaps you should consider how you would have felt if your friend had been late to meet you—you likely would have been annoyed. While that is a simple version of how to imagine yourself in the shoes of someone else, this is exactly what you will be doing. You are looking at the other person’s situation and trying to figure out how their situation would make you feel. You are going to want to consider as much as you can when you do this—where they grew up, what do they have available to them, and anything about them that is relevant to this situation. Are they annoyed because they feel like you have grown up too sheltered from consequences, perhaps? Or maybe because they feel like you, just like everyone else, do not respect them for some reason. With that idea of how they are feeling, you should then take a moment to investigate any of the underlying feelings that may be guiding the other person. Now that you recognize that your friend is annoyed at you for being late, for example, you are able to ask questions for further understanding to figure out why it mattered in the first place. In developing this understanding of what they feel and why you are able to begin empathizing with the other person. Over time, you may find that this process becomes quite automatic—you no longer have to think about it. That is a good thing and it is a sign that you are naturally becoming more emotionally intelligent. Making Good Eye Contact Making good eye contact with other people is a critical skill. When you can make good, healthy eye contact, you are effectively allowing yourself to acknowledge the other party. You are telling them that they matter to you simply because you are actively looking at them. Making good eye contact is actually surprisingly simple—when you need to make eye contact with someone else, you should follow the rule of making eye contact 50% of the time when you are speaking and 70% of the time when you are listening. This allows the other person to see that you are attentive and interested in them, while also reminding them to continue speaking to you. If you find that making active eye contact is too difficult for any reason at all, you may find that looking at the bridge of their nose fools them too. As far as the other person will be concerned, you will be making eye contact with them, and you are able to avoid it if you find that direct eye contact is uncomfortable or too much for you to manage. However, even the illusion of eye contact can go a long way. Active Listening Another crucial social skill, especially if you wish to be emotionally intelligent, is being able to listen actively. Too many people make the mistake of listening with the intent to reply to what is being said rather than to actively listen to what is being said. When you listen actively, you are effectively ensuring that the speaker feels acknowledged and like you truly care. If you wish to be emotionally intelligent, you are focused on trying to make that a priority. Effectively, then, you will be actively attempting to listen with the intent to understand. Doing so is not as difficult as it may seem. All you need to do is start by making eye contact as the other party speaks. As you listen, you should always be paying your undivided attention to the other party. No distractions should be allowed during this phase. Make sure that you are actively listening and nodding your head to show that you are listening. The most important part, however, is to remember that as you listen, you should be focused on listening only. There should be no attempts to come up with your own responses to the other party—you should simply be making it a point to hear and understand. When the other person finishes speaking, before you reply, you must try to recap what was said. In your own words, offer a brief summary of what you believe was said and then ask to make sure you got it right. If they agree, then you can take the time to figure out your reply. If they inform you that you are wrong, however, you must ask clarifying questions to make sure that you do get a solid understanding. Only after you have that understanding are you able to finally put together your reply to ensure that you have actively listened. Understanding Body Language Finally, one last skill that will not be instructed, but is strongly recommended that you check out is the ability to read and understand body language. Effectively, when you learn how to read the body language of other people, you are enabling yourself to better understand them. You are learning how best to understand those around you when you learn to read their nonverbal communication. If you wish to be emotionally intelligent and are ready to move on to skills beyond what has been included in the book thus far, moving on to analyzing people is probably the best place for you to go. Conclusion Congratulations! You have made it to the end of Emotional Intelligence & Cognitive Behavioral Therapy! At this point, you have taken a look into both emotional intelligence and CBT, two methods of self improvement that are readily actionable without requiring the instruction of a professional. Hopefully, your journey of reading through this book was informative and pleasing for you. Every effort was made to ensure that what you read was something that you could act upon, relate to, and readily understand. Perhaps the most important takeaway from this book, above all, is the fact that thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are intricately related to one another. Remember the fact that your thoughts will always influence your feelings, which will always influence your behaviors, and use that understanding to really push your own social interactions forward. You will not only be able to control yourself better in knowing these cycles, but you will also be able to predict other people’s behaviors as well, allowing you to begin to develop that propensity for relationship management that is so important within emotional intelligence. As you read through this book, you were guided through a solid understanding of what emotional intelligence is. You learned about the purpose of EQ, as well as the pillars that help build it, along with the primary skills within each pillar. From there, you took a look into cognitive behavioral therapy, another process that can help you learn to self regulate, which in turn, makes it valuable to emotional intelligence.

Emotional and Narcissistic Abuse Recovery A Guide to Understand Emotional Narcissism, Identify the Narcissist and Escape from Narcissistic Techniques. Use Empathy to Recover from Narcissistic Abuses Introduction Congratulations on purchasing Emotional and Narcissistic Abuse Recovery, and thank you for doing so. Have you ever had that feeling of dread when you look at the clock and realize that someone will be home soon? Maybe it was a parent, or perhaps it was a romantic partner. You know that they are on their way, and you immediately dread it. Instead of being at ease, you find yourself stressed out and on edge. You may find that you dread being around the other person, and any time you know that you will have to see him or her, you cannot help but feel your own anxiety spike, even if you have no reason that you can think of to be so uncomfortable. If you know that feeling of dread that comes when you face seeing someone that you know, you may be suffering from narcissistic or emotional abuse. Now, you may be thinking that the person that you are afraid of has never laid a hand on you, or that you cannot possibly think of a time during which the other person was abusive. However, not all abuse leaves a physical mark. In fact, some of the worst abuse that a person can endure never leaves a physical mark at all. It is possible that you have been suffering from emotional or narcissistic abuse without being aware of it. Your unconscious mind may recognize that what has been happening is not right or normal, causing you to feel afraid or anxious without reason. If you are not aware of the signs, it can be easy to miss them, and you may instead entirely overlook the true cause as being unnecessary anxiety that needs to be medicated or treated in some other way. However, this abuse is very real, and the effects of the abuse hurting other people are real as well. This book is your guide to identifying emotional and narcissistic abuse. You will be able to tell if you are, in fact, suffering from one of these invisible types of abuse, and if you are, you will be given the tools that you will need to handle it. You will be instructed on what to expect in abusive situations, how to recognize them, and how to heal from them, allowing you to reclaim your life once and for all. Remember, no one should feel like they have to live life in fear. Being in your home should not be a source of anxiety, nor should you ever have to feel like you must constantly interact with someone that makes you uncomfortable. When you read through this book, you will discover how to recognize several types of abuse, some of which you may have never realized were abusive in the first place. You will learn how to recognize and recover from emotional abuse. You will then be introduced to recognizing the narcissist—a particularly insidious personality type that usually leads to manipulative, coercive, and abusive treatment of those around them. You will learn how to recognize the narcissistic abuser, as well as the narcissist’s favorite tactics to abuse. You will learn how deeply the narcissist’s abuse can hit, even if you are not ever harmed physically. Finally, you will be introduced to the empath, a personality type that, due to the kind nature and desire to help others, usually ends up taken advantage of by manipulators and abusers everywhere. You will learn about the empath’s greatest strength —empathy, and how that power of empathy can help overcome the abuse that has been faced. As you read through this book, it is with the utmost hope that you will find it to be helpful, instructive, and provide you with an actionable advice that you can follow and use in order to protect yourself from abuse, or if you have already found yourself abused, it will point you in the right direction to healing. Keep in mind that you do not have to suffer through abuse, and if you ever feel like you are in active danger, please consult with your local domestic violence hotline to help you.

Chapter 1: Abuse in Relationships When people think of abuse, they typically think of the kind that leaves noticeable evidence behind—physical and sexual abuse. However, abuse comes in all shapes and sizes, with different effects and results. Would you consider being yelled at to shut up abuse? What about being called names while yelling? Throwing something at the wall? Punching a door? Not providing you with the access you need and deserve to familial funds? Threatening to take custody of your children? All of these are different forms of abuse, and not a single one of them ever involved laying a finger on the other person. Abuse is dangerous—not only can it cause serious physical or emotional harm, but it can also cause serious mental health issues, or even lead to death, substance abuse, or self harm. Abuse is nothing to ever be ignored, and if you ever suspect that someone is being abused, reaching out to them in private can be the right thing to do. If you are the victim of abuse, you do not have to suffer any longer—you can take a stand and leave once and for all. It may be intimidating or seem entirely impossible to leave, especially if you are financially dependent upon the abuser, but you can make that call to leave if you choose to do so. What is Abuse? Consider for a moment the definition of the word “Abuse.” If you were to look up a definition online or in a dictionary, you would be provided with something along the lines of misuse of an item, or to treat with cruelty or violence. Abuse can be used to refer to the misuse of, for example, alcohol, during which the one drinking frequently drinks far too much, whether due to addiction or due to some other factor. Abuse of power can happen when a judge passes a judgment that is entirely designed to benefit the judge or push an agenda rather than making the right call. You may even hear people say that items are abused, such as saying that a child’s favorite toy has really stood up to a lot of abuse. This means that, despite rough usage, the toy has held up. Despite the wide range of how the word itself can be used, within the scope of this book, we will be focusing solely on the definition of abuse is relevant to the mistreatment or harm to others. More specifically, we are going to add one extra element when discussing abuse within this book—it must be intentional. Effectively, then, abuse will be defined for the duration of this book as the intentional act of harming another person for reasons other than self defense. The only justifiable act of harming another person or animal is to either consume after humanely hunting or slaughtering or in self defense during which you were not the aggressor. This means, then, that any time that someone hurts you intentionally, no matter how you were hurt, you have suffered abuse. Of course, abuse will vary in severity. You could be slapped on the bottom by some random stranger walking down the street, which would obviously be distressing, but not necessarily life changing. You could also be forcibly held down and violently assaulted. Both are still abuse, and both are still wrong, but on the spectrum, there is a vast range of differences in severity. One thing still holds true—you deserve to live your life free of abuse. This is a message that you will see repeated throughout this book because it is so critical to hear. You deserve to be treated with kindness, not abused. Who is Abused? However, though you and those around you deserve to be treated with kindness, you are far from alone. Abuse runs rampant around the world. Especially in the United States, the statistics on abuse are extreme. It is believed that 1/3 of women and 1/5 of men have been abused either physically, sexually, or psychologically, at some point in their lives. This abuse happens to people of all ages. Babies and young children are common targets. 1/3 teens have reported already having experienced violence and abuse during their own relationships. Effectively, anyone can be the victim of abuse. Rich or poor, young or old, abuse can happen to anyone. In fact, every single minute, 24 people are raped, abused, or stalked by a domestic or intimate partner within the United States alone. 48% of adults within the US have found themselves on the receiving end of psychological abuse within their lifetimes If you are the victim of abuse, do not be afraid to reach out—you are truly not alone, and other people can relate to you and your struggles. Just because abuse is so rampant and prevalent does not mean that you need to take it without fighting back, nor should you simply accept it. You can choose to leave. You can choose to stand up for yourself. You can choose to escape. It is not always easy, but you can do it. Reasons for Abuse First and foremost, it is important to acknowledge that abuse is never justifiable. It is never acceptable to intentionally hurt someone else, no matter how angry they have made you, nor how much they refuse to obey. People are not designed to be puppets, and no matter the relationship that you have, you always have free will. You can choose when to be sexually intimate and when you do not want to. You can decide what you will eat and what you will refuse. You decide who you talk to and who you will avoid. No matter what you have done, even if you have been unfaithful or done something that your partner is disapproving of, you do not even deserve to be intentionally harmed. Ultimately, most abuse endured is because one person desires power—they want to be in control, and the best way to do that is to force the other person to submit. They may believe that they own their partner, or that they have some say in what their partners are allowed to do, especially in marriage. However, this could not be further from the truth—you can choose who you want to associate with if you so choose. Other times, abuse is endured because the abuser believes that his or her needs come first—they want to feel like their partner should always prioritize their needs and will use abusive tactics to make it happen. They will intentionally remove the idea of equality within the relationship, making it clear to the victim that the abuser is dominant and more important. In doing so, the victim often eventually internalizes that he or she must always make the other person happy. Effectively, then, abuse is a power play. It is done to assert control over the victim to ensure that the victim feels powerless. In feeling powerless, the victim believes that he or she has no choice but continue to endure the abuse without argument or question. This is part of the reason why so many victims refuse to leave—they feel like they cannot. Abuse on its own is learned—people are rarely just abusive without having ever been exposed to it before. It may have been learned during childhood when abusive tactics were used growing up, such as a son growing up around an abusive father and naturally behaving exactly the same way toward his own partners and children in adulthood. It could have been seen on television or other forms of media and slowly internalized over a lifetime of exposure that has normalized abusive tendencies. What does not cause abuse, however, is the victim, and if the abuser ever tells you that it is your own fault that he or she acts that way, then they are in denial or trying to convince you of something that is not true to keep you under their thumbs for longer. Drugs and alcohol also do not cause abuse— someone who is intoxicated may be abusive, but it is because those tendencies are already present. Stress does not cause abuse, either. Someone who is not abusive will not see abuse as an option at all. Types of Abuse Abuse of all kinds is traumatic, no matter who it was that was abusive to you. While people tend to have an easy time recognizing physical abuse thanks to the literal marks it can leave on someone else, people often struggle to recognize other types of abuse as well. Despite the fact that abuse is as rampant as it is, people do not tend to recognize most kinds, and this chapter aims to change that. Reading through this section can be incredibly valuable to you. As you do, you can become capable of identifying and recognizing several of the more insidious forms of abuse that can usually slip under the radar. For example, some people may strongly feel that it is impossible for a husband to sexually abuse a wife—that is not true. When you know about some of the more obscure or less apparent forms of abuse, you will be in a far better position to resist that abuse or recognize when it is time to exit the relationship. Remember, no matter how much that your abuser tells you that you are stuck, or that you have no choice but to submit, remember that there are options out there for you. All you need to do is reach out. You do not need to live with abuse, and you can make a plan to leave. There are people who work on domestic violence hotlines that are ready and willing to help you. They can help you find resources in your local area and help you come up with a plan to help, no matter where you are or what your situation is. You do not deserve to live with any form of abuse. Primarily, abuse comes in several forms. We will look in particular about six of these right now: Emotional, financial, physical, sexual, spiritual, and narcissistic. Each of these happen differently, but they all have the potential to be harmful. You can be hurt by every single one of these forms of abuse, and just because you are not being touched physically does not mean that your abuse is not that bad. Please do not downplay your abuse or try to compare it to the abuse endured by other people. Forms o abuse ye S a A Emotional abuse Emotional abuse, also commonly referred to as psychological, verbal, or mental abuse, is a form of abuse during which the abuser uses mind games and emotions in order to gain control. The abuser wants to be able to manipulate your emotions and your mind in order to make sure that you do not feel secure enough to escape or to make you feel like you are incapable of escaping. This form of abuse is particularly insidious because it never leaves physical marks on the victim and is next to impossible to prove. When you are the victim of emotional abuse, you feel entirely incapable. You feel like you are stuck, but also left doubting whether you are actually being abused or if you are simply too sensitive about the situation. Emotional abuse is real and is wrong, and even though it may not leave a mark on you, it will impact your emotional state severely. Financial abuse Financial abuse is exactly what it sounds like—keeping finances away from the victim or somehow exerting control over the victim. Especially in a marriage, both parties should have equal access to finances, as marriage is generally approached as a team. Unless agreed to prior to that point, if one partner suddenly commandeers all control of the finances or restricts access to the finances, there may be financial abuse occurring. During financial abuse, one party’s access to the funds or to making money is restricted or hurt. Because finances and access to money are necessary to survive, restricting access to these funds can make it impossible to get out of a negative, abusive relationship. Along those lines as well, it is next to impossible to find a home if credit is destroyed. By damaging financial security, the abuser makes it, so the victim is far more reliant on the abuser, meaning that the victim lacks power. It may also encompass one’s credit as well. This is effectively anything that threatens the financial wellbeing of the individual being discussed, whether that is racking up debt, destroying credit, restricting access to money, or even threatening the workplace of the victim. Physical abuse Physical abuse is perhaps the easiest of them all to identify. Physical abuse is particularly known for being painful. It is physical attempts to restrain, subdue, or abuse the victim. In general, if you are being threatened physically or put into a dangerous situation, you are physically abused. One such form of this that people may not realize is kicking the victim out of the car in a dangerous area or leaving him or her locked outside, particularly if it is hot or cold. People have a right to shelter and intentionally interfering with that, making you stay outside, which is a form of physical abuse. This is perhaps the most immediately threatening of the forms of abuse that you can suffer. If you feel that you are at risk for physical abuse, or if you have been hit, you do have rights and repercussions. Please reach out for help and do not tolerate any physical abuse at all. This abuse has a tendency to continually get worse and worse as time goes on, and it is believed that a staggering three women per day are killed by their intimate partners just within the US alone. This is a terrifying number and is all the more reason that the instant a relationship turns physical, it should be ended. Sexual abuse Sexual abuse is something that people think is cut and dry, but actually has some nuances to it. You may feel like you have not been sexually abused if you do not know that certain occurrences are actually considered abusive, but the effects are undeniable. Even if you were unaware that you were sexually abused, you might find that what you have endured may actually be classified in this manner. You do not have to be violently raped by a stranger for your abuse that you have endured to be considered sexual abuse or assault. In fact, you can be assaulted or abused sexually by a partner or even a spouse. Marriage is not a license for free, uncensored access to the other person’s body. Even being pestered for sexual intimacy is a form of sexual abuse—if anything other than your enthusiastic and consensual yes to sexual activity is pursued, you may find that your partner is attempting to intentionally coerce or browbeat you into giving in. Remember, even in marriage, you retain full rights to your body and you are under no obligation to engage in any sort of sexual contact that you wish to avoid. Spiritual abuse Spiritual abuse is another of those forms of abuse that is particularly tricky to identify, but once you know what it is, you are able to point it out a bit easier. This is any time that an abuser attacks a victim’s choice in religion. It can happen to people from any religious type, and anyone can suffer from it. It is done to directly attack one’s religion, which is oftentimes one of the most intimate, innermost parts of their own belief system. To attack their belief system is to truly attack the individual, and it can be incredibly distressing. It can happen during a relationship, especially in contexts such as one person intentionally berating the other’s religious choices or preventing the victim from being able to practice. Sometimes, the abuser may even use their own or your own religious texts to justify the abuse, pointing to lines that are being misconstrued, such as allowing the man to lead with the woman falling back and obeying at all costs. Narcissistic abuse Finally, the last form of abuse that is being discussed here is narcissistic abuse. Narcissistic abuse refers to any abuse that has occurred by a narcissist. This book will spend several chapters discussing the narcissist and narcissistic abuse as it progresses. In particular, narcissists are particularly insidious with their abuse. They tend to be abusive simply because they do not see any reason for them not to get their way. They have a distorted view of reality around them, and because of that, they tend to try to browbeat everything into fitting their own views on the world. This is quite problematic—when they are actively trying to make everything else conform to their delusions, they end up harming several people in the process. More specifically, however, the narcissists are masters at manipulation and abuse. They are skilled in making the abuse that they are dishing out seem like it must be the fault of the victim, and they will not acknowledge anything beyond that as being the truth. In fact, they are so certain about their own viewpoints, that they will claim that anyone else’s perception of the truth is false. For now, all that matters is that you know that narcissistic abuse exists in its own category and that it encompasses all types of abuse. We will delve into this topic in depth later. Effects of Abuse When you have been the victim of abuse, you may find that you have begun to change. You may not be able to notice it at first, but eventually, you notice that you are no longer the person you used to be. In particular, you may find some of the following effects are present in your life. These are effectively your emotional injuries in response to the harm that you have endured. Remember, some abuse can happen without ever leaving a physical mark, but the emotional scars that are there remain potentially for a lifetime. Some of these effects are: e Anxiety (including post traumatic stress disorder): When you have been the victim of abuse, you are likely constantly living in a state of hyper vigilance. You are afraid of what is going to happen if you remain in the relationship, but you are afraid of what will happen when you leave as well. Post traumatic stress disorder is also a common anxiety disorder that many abuse victims suffer from, and this will be discussed in depth in Chapter 7: The Effects of Narcissistic Abuse. e Depression: When you are constantly afraid for your life or sense of self, it becomes incredibly common to suffer from depression as well as you lose your ability to enjoy life. You may struggle to actively enjoy what is happening around you or feel like you cannot get out of bed. You may suffer from a lack of energy and lack of motivation to take care of yourself, your responsibilities, and your home. Risky behaviors: When you have been abused, you may find that you spend more time than usual acting out. You may, for example, speed or drive without a seatbelt. You may engage in risky, unprotected sex with others. You may use or abuse drugs. Ultimately, you do not care about what will happen to you, so you do not take the necessary precautions that would be used to keep you safe. Substance abuse: You may even decide to self medicate through drugs and alcohol, or find that your abusive partner encourages you to feed your addiction. You find that drugs or alcohol serve as a sort of release and escape from the abuse and this can very quickly spiral into abuse of the substance, and potentially even addiction or overdoes if you are not careful. Self harm or thoughts of suicide: Another common coping mechanism is self harm. You may intentionally hurt yourself to provide some feelings of control over the situation that you have found yourself in. While unhealthy, you feel like you are able to control when you hurt, and that can make you feel like you have reclaimed some power. If you are having thoughts of self harm or suicide, it is important that you reach out to a licensed medical professional, as this is considered a medical emergency and you will be able to get the help that you need. Low self esteem: When you are constantly being told that you are undeserving or unworthy, you will eventually internalize it and believe that it is true. This does not mean that you are weak or make it true—it just means that you have heard it so often that you believe it. However, lacking self esteem can then mean that you do not trust yourself and that you doubt your ability to get yourself out of the relationship. Avoidance of relationships or other triggers: If you have been abused in the past, you may choose to avoid relationships altogether. Especially if you have suffered on more than one occasion, you may just feel like it is simpler to avoid the relationships altogether than it is to try to find a healthy one. The Cycle of Abuse Before we address the rest of this book, there is one important concept that must be remembered—abuse exists in a cycle. Not only is this cycle generational, meaning that children who grew up in an abusive environment grow up to create abusive environments themselves, but also in the sense that abuse within a single relationship tends to occur within a very specific, predictable cycle during which things are sometimes comfortable and happy, but other times, abuse is highly prevalent. People often take those honeymoon periods, the periods during which the abuse is absent, as signs that the relationship is worth salvaging, but consider this for a moment: If the relationship were only abusive all of the time, would anyone want to stay? No one would want to put up with nonstop abuse—there has to be some sort of good there as well to keep the individual interested in staying and motivated to continue to return to the relationship. The cycle of abuse occurs in four distinct stages: Tensions building, an incident, reconciliation, and the calm. Building Stage 4: The Stage 2: The Calm Incident During the first stage of tensions building, there is a tension present in the relationship. You may feel like communication is breaking down or that you and your partner are simply constantly annoying each other. The victim may feel like they are heading toward another incident of abuse and try anything to try to please and placate the abuser in hopes of avoiding it. Communication will continue to degrade, and there may be frequent arguments or disagreements during this period. The second stage, known as the incident stage, is when the abuse happens. Usually, there is a big blowout—it may be physical abuse, or it may be an argument or an attempt to control or coerce the victim. The abuser may yell, call names, threaten to leave, intimidate, attempt to force sexual intimacy, or attempt other forms of violence or abuse. This is the big, scary event that the victim was trying to avoid. After the incident, the abuser realizes that the abuse has occurred and moves into damage control. In particular, he will aim for reconciliation, which refers to the name of this stage. They will often apologize, but that apology is generally insincere and meant to simply placate the victim. The victim is oftentimes blamed at this time, or the abuser will deny that abuse has happened at all. It may also be downplayed in order to convince the victim that things are not as bad as the victim may see them. Also common at this stage is an apology with a promise to do better, seek counseling, or work somehow on the relationship. However, these efforts to better the relationship rarely, if ever, actually occur. Finally, after reconciliation is complete comes the calm in the storm—this is the brief respite during which the victim is reminded of all of the reasons he or she fell in love or was pulled into the relationship in the first place. This is the stage known as the honeymoon period. During this time, the relationship seems fine—the abuse is forgotten or forgiven, and the abuser is often found showering the victim with affection and gifts. During this period, the victim is reminded of why he or she wants to remain in the relationship. The Challenges of Escaping Abuse At this point, after reading through the struggles that so many people face in abusive relationships, you may have a single question going through your mind—why do they not just leave? After all, it would be as simple as just walking out the door and not returning, right? While it is always a possibility to leave, there is a lot more to unpack with that. It is a complicated issue—yes, leaving is the right move when you are in an abusive relationship, but there are often outside factors beyond the fact that abuse is present that needs to be considered. Remember, abuse is about exerting power and control, and when you try to leave an abuser, you are directly taking back that power. Thus far, in that relationship, the abuser has used abuse to retain that power, and leaving will not change that. Oftentimes, leaving is the most dangerous time in an abusive relationship— the abuser is likely to retaliate and make leaving as difficult and painful as possible to force the victim into submission. Beyond the danger of leaving, there may be several other factors that come into play within that particular relationship, such as struggling to leave because children are involved. When children are present in the relationship, leaving is no longer as simple as packing up and disappearing, especially if the children are shared. The abusive parent still has rights to the children that cannot simply be revoked without court permission, and that revocation rarely happens. Victims may instead choose to stay in the relationship, so they have access to their children instead of having to share their children with the abusive parent for long stretches of time. Another common challenge and roadblock that people hit is that of their culture or religion. Many cultures and religions reject the idea of divorce or separation, and others still expect subservience of women to the men. When you are told that you must be obedient to your husband and that your husband is in the right to hit or hurt you, you are going to feel like you cannot leave. You are going to be so caught up in what is right by your culture and in your relationship that escaping becomes incredibly frowned upon. If you know that you cannot divorce in the eyes of your religion, or that you risk your culture rejecting you for giving up on your relationship, you may find that you are happier keeping your current community, even if that means tolerating the abuse. Some people simply do not have the physical capacity to leave due to an illness or disability They may not be mobile enough to live on their own, or they may require help for basic day to day survival, and they feel like their best chance is staying in the relationship and dealing with the abuse. They may even have significant health issues that prevent them from being able to take care of their children, so instead of leaving the relationship, they stay to continue to live with their children in an effort to protect them. Other people may find that they are too embarrassed to reach out for help because of the stigmas surrounding abuse. If you have been the victim of abuse, it can be difficult to reach out to others. Especially if your partner has spent the relationship telling you that everything is your own fault, you may feel like you will be harshly judged for your own victimization, despite the fact that the victim is never deserving of abuse. Sometimes, fear holds the individual back. Perhaps your partner has threatened suicide or to hurt you if you leave, or you worry about how you will be able to support yourself and your children without another person helping to pay for household necessities. You may be afraid that your abuser will not go without a fight and that the abuse will escalate if you attempt to leave. In particular with regards to fear, in many cases, immigration status can also play a significant role as well if the victim is not documented within the country, they oftentimes feel like they have to put up with it, as if they go to court, or if the victim reaches out for help, the victim will simply be deported. Especially if the individual has children that are citizens of the country that the victim is undocumented within, the victim may remain silent in order to avoid being deported and separated. A significant lack of resources can also leave someone suffering from abuse of any kind feeling entirely trapped in a bad situation, and the abusers know this. This is exactly why they will take advantage of financial abuse to make leaving harder. You may not have the money to pay for a home for yourself and your children. You may not have a car to drive away in. You may not have access to the finances in the family, and even if you are actively contributing to them, you may not have access. If you simply do not have the resources, you may be afraid to try, especially if you are pregnant or have children. Sometimes simply not having support from friends or family can make you feel trapped and alone. Without access to other people to talk to, you may find that you cannot discuss what is happening, nor do you have anyone to reach out to when things get bad. Without a sort of sounding board in someone else, you may find that you do not see the relationship as being as bad as you may initially think, especially if it has been a slow escalation up to that point. Alternatively, you may find that your friends and family members do not see the abuse that you are enduring, and they often try to downplay it or ask if it is truly as bad as you are saying. Of course, one of the most compelling reasons that people find to stay in their relationships despite the abuse is love. They truly love their partners, and that is enough to make sure that they are staying in their relationships that they otherwise would have left. Other times, what can hold you back is love. After all, if you did not love your abuser, you would likely not be willing to put up with the abuse at all. When you love your partner, you may hold onto hope that the abuser will change, as promised, and you will give chance after chance, hoping that you can get the person that you have fallen in love with back. One final reason that you may find that people are likely to stay behind is that the relationship and the abuse has been normalized. This means that it seems entirely normal to you instead of as something that may be a huge red flag. Think of how, in some cultures, it may be entirely fine to make eye contact and smile, but in others, eye contact is seen as disrespectful and rude—eye contact is not normalized in those countries and cultures. If you have grown up around abuse and it has simply become normalized, you will not see the problem. If you grew up in a household where the parents regularly yelled at each other, you might feel like yelling is entirely normal when mad. You feel like these unhealthy coping mechanisms are nothing but passionate expressions of feelings and do not acknowledge the abuse because you do not recognize it. Chapter 2: Recognizing Emotional Abuse For the next several chapters, we will be specifically addressing emotional abuse. You now know what it is, at least on the surface—you know that emotional abuse is a form of psychological control and just how dangerous it may be. However, do you know how to recognize it? Do you know how to label several of the most common abuse tactics? This particular form of abuse tends to be incredibly covert—it is designed to be hidden in plain sight, and in reading this chapter, you will learn how to identify it. If you can stop and think of a time during which you felt like you were not good enough, like your partner was doing you a huge favor by staying with you, it may be time to reevaluate your relationship. If you have ever come to the realization that the voice that you were using to talk about yourself as the voice of someone else instead of your own, you may have suffered from emotional abuse at some point. Emotional abuse is commonly referred to as verbal or psychological abuse, and it is designed to make you feel bad about yourself. It is meant to make you feel like you are not worthy, that you are not deserving of respect, and that you are not in control. The whole purpose of emotional abuse is that dominance over the victim, designed to grant the abuser free reign over the individual. The more emotional abuse one has endured, most often, the more subservient they become. They stop trying to fight back and slowly do begin to believe that they were deserving of the abuse. This chapter will guide you through learning to recognize the signs of abuse. You will learn how to identify the most common behaviors exhibited by the abuse victims, as well as the long term effects of suffering from emotional abuse. From there, you will be guided through several common and favored emotional abuse tactics designed to keep the victim on edge, out of control, and subservient. Signs of Emotional Abuse within the Relationship It can be difficult to spot an abusive relationship, especially if you are in the outside looking in. However, an emotionally abusive relationship typically looks drastically different from a healthy one, and if you are able to spend enough time around someone in an emotionally abusive relationship, you may find that you are able to identify several of these signs on a regular basis. Take the time to familiarize yourself with these common signs of emotional abuse within a relationship. If you notice that a friend or family member has a relationship with several of these signs, you may want to consider reaching out to ensure that everything is okay and offer your own support if it is needed. These signs can be incredibly stressful for both the one suffering from the abuse and the one who may be witnessing such abhorrent behaviors. If you have felt like a relationship that you have been exposed to seems like it is not quite right, it may be that it is manipulative and abusive in nature. In these instances, many people feel like turning away is the right thing to do, but if you see someone struggling in a relationship with several red flags, such as the ones that will be discussed in a moment, the kind thing to do is reach out. Identifying an emotionally abusive relationship can be quite concerning and nerve wracking, especially if it is your relationship or the relationship of a loved one. However, if you can identify it, you can help the other person escape. You can offer your support. You can understand that the behaviors of isolation and avoidance are probably not coming from the victim but rather forced by the abuser. Generally, identifying an abusive partner of one of your friends or family members can be quite obvious—while the victim may be unwilling to admit it, everyone knows when they are having to walk on eggshells. However, oftentimes, when people have to deal with their friends or family members being abused, they feel like they must choose between either begrudgingly tolerating the abuser, despite being incredibly concerned about the behavior out of fear of being cut off if they do not, or they do say something, only to have the abuser freeze them out. After all, the only way that you can truly help someone get out of an abusive relationship is if they truly want to escape it. If they are not interested in that escape, you are not going to be able to do much other than offer support until that time during which they do decide to leave. Now, imagine that your best friend, Cara, has a boyfriend named Austin. Cara is the sweetest young woman that you know—she was never particularly self confident, but she was so kind that no one was bothered by the lack of self esteem. They simply gently reminded her that she was a well loved member of the social group and always happily invited her over. Seemingly out of nowhere, Cara met him—Austin was a man a few years older than her, but she did not mind. She was happy because he showered her with lavish attention and love. He was always wanting to spend time with her, sending constant messages to her and checking in on her. If she did not answer a text message within five minutes of it being sent, however, he would call her, and whatever he was saying was leaving Cara visibly distressed. When she would get off of the phone, she would apologize and leave, saying that he was demanding that she get home, or he would not be there later that night. Over time, as Austin grew more and more comfortable, you and your friends noticed several red flags in the relationship. You saw how he would yell at Cara on a regular basis, both in public and out of public scrutiny. She would recount times during which he would scream and berate her to her face at home, and when you tried to point out that she did not deserve it, she simply shrugged and said that she deserved it because she was not particularly smart and she was lucky to have him. Soon, it seemed like even your social nights grew affected by the presence of Austin—he would not allow Cara to go to those hangout sessions any longer simply because he could not be there as well. In fact, she slowly was only allowed to go to places that he was present at as well, claiming that she was promiscuous and would be cheating on him if she were left to her own devices. You noticed that when he was around, he seemed to have knowledge of private conversations, and it became clear that he was monitoring her text messages. Soon, her social media accounts disappeared altogether. Over time, you noticed that Cara was becoming more stressed out. She seemed to withdraw from the group more and more, until one day, she broke down and told you that he had been threatening to kill himself if she left him, and though she wanted to leave so badly, she felt like she had no choice but to stay. She described the look of absolute, unadulterated fury in his eyes when she said that she wanted space and told you that she was certain he was going to seriously injure her. It was only when she shook off her interest in leaving as a joke and that she wanted to see how much he loved her that he seemed to settle down. Stop and see what problems you can identify within that short passage about your friend Cara and Austin. What was Austin doing that was problematic? Which behaviors would need to be entirely cut for the relationship to retain any sort of semblance of healthiness? Would it be possible for that to become a healthy relationship at all with how far it had flown into an abusive relationship? If you took the time, you may have noticed at least six distinctive red flags about Austin’s behavior that would be considered abusive. He spent a significant time yelling at her, for one. He would intimidate everyone with how loudly his voice would carry, and it constantly kept Cara down. The yelling was constantly joined by insults and berating that were so extreme that Cara herself was convinced that she must deserve it. There was no sense of privacy within the relationship, and it seemed like Austin was fully convinced that Cara needed some sort of chaperone to be able to involve herself in any group activities. You knew that she was not the kind of girl to ever fall for infidelity, but he was convinced that she was. She had to check in on a regular basis—yet another red flag, and eventually, she was required to take him anywhere that she wanted to go to make sure that she was not getting caught up in any funny business.

You may already know the answer to this or knew that it was abusive before reading this book, or you may suspect that it is abusive, and if this is the case, you may want to pay close attention to these signs. Let’s take some time to delve into Cara’s perspective on her abusive relationship in order to really see the victim’s perspective. These signs that are coming up are all huge red flags that Cara should have acknowledged, but she was far too afraid to. She may have been blinded by her love for her partner, or she may simply have been caught up in the idea of how great it would be to be in a relationship, and she was willing to put up with the beginning of the abuse. Ultimately, the only way that you can really identify emotional abuse will be through looking to find how you are feeling at any given point. You must be able to recognize your own emotions, developing that self awareness of your own current states. There are several patterns for how the victims of emotional abuse usually feel, and while the victim may acknowledge that he or she is unhappy, it can be difficult to really articulate how they feel if they do not know how to convey it. Reading this section through Cara’s perspective is an attempt to remedy that. We will look at how Cara has been feeling, self reflecting on whether she is in an abusive relationship. From the outside looking in, you may already be confident that she is being abused—because she is. However, it is much harder from the victim’s side to identify this. Firstly, Cara realizes that she is not happy. She knows that, but she is struggling to identify exactly how she is not happy or why she is miserable. She has a general understanding that the behaviors she has been exposed to are problematic, but she does not quite know how to articulate it. She is not sure if she is just overreacting or acting like things are far worse than they actually are—and then she realizes it. She feels like she cannot trust herself. A favorite tactic of the emotional abuser is called gaslighting—it will be discussed in greater depth later, but for all intents and purposes, it is meant to make you feel like you cannot trust your own perceptions of reality. It is designed to make you feel like you are always wrong about how you see the world, or that you are always overreacting, when in fact, you may be right. This is because you will likely rely on your partner if you feel like your Own perceptions are wrong, and the abuser is counting on this. This is exactly what happened with Austin—she constantly felt like her own emotions were wrong. She internalized the abuse and blamed it on herself because she was parroting what he had to say, not what she truly believed about herself. This is incredibly powerful to acknowledge—it means that she understands the root of her problem. She has lost trust in herself. In losing trust in herself, she feels like she is out of control, and for good reason. She has no real control over her life, what she does, or where she goes. She is constantly told what she can do and why she cannot go see other people. She has found that she has fallen into compliance simply because it was better than dealing with the alternative—his threats of suicide and his anger outbursts that would leave her afraid of her partner. Being afraid of him is yet another problem. After all, you should never feel like you have to be afraid of your partner or what he will do. If you feel like you are afraid of your partner, you may need to reevaluate and figure out what is going on to make you feel afraid. You may find the answer relatively simply, or you may realize that it is an unconscious sign that you should be more careful or distrustful of your partner. Unfortunately, Cara had spent so long listening to her fears that she was struggling to escape. His threats of suicide left her feeling three different ways: she was afraid to care for herself because trying to do so constantly angered him. In his mind, she was meant to shower him with what he wanted, and her needs were entirely meaningless. She was constantly feeling guilty due to his own manipulative techniques. Though she could never quite articulate it, she always found herself feeling guilty for everything. It really beat down her sense of self esteem, and she struggled to come back from it. Finally, between wanting to avoid the fear and the guilt, she found herself preferring to walk on eggshells around her partner. She was happier just keeping him happy and complying with whatever was asked of her because compliance meant that she did not have to worry about him being angry or having an outburst. It was easy to just placate him and keep him happy. Further analysis and self reflection would help Cara realize two more important aspects of her life that were major red flags: She constantly apologized, even when whatever happened had nothing to do with her. Despite the fact that she was not at fault, it was easier to apologize in an attempt to placate an unfortunate side effect of walking on eggshells on a regular basis. She found that, despite loving Austin with all her heart, she no longer craved intimacy with him. This is a massive red flag—people who love each other typically want to be intimate. They do this to get as close as possible to each other and do so from a position of trust and love. However, when you no longer feel safe or trust your relationship, you instead find that you are constantly panicking instead. People need to feel safe to be interested in intimacy, and people being abused rarely feel that safety necessary. Amidst this all, however, perhaps the most confusing thing of all for Cara was that she felt an intense need to protect the abuser. She felt like she would have to rationalize away his behaviors and tell everyone around her that he was not so bad because she loves him. She wanted to be able to protect him precisely because she does love him. These are all incredibly common realizations that guide people from realizing that they are, in fact, in an emotionally abusive relationship. They realize that their own lives have become so relatable to the account of our fictional friend, Cara, that they are shocked. They may realize just how dangerous the relationship actually is, and in realizing that, they can begin the process of healing as they continue to progress. Effects of Emotional Abuse Emotional abuse has all sorts of negative effects that last far longer than the relationship. You may find that you carry these signs with you well after having ended the relationship, and in some cases, they will not go away without any attempts to get therapy or seek some other way to treat it. These are effectively the scars of your abuse—you may not have ever received any physical ones, but the emotional ones are just as real and just as enduring. A Damaged Sense of Self If you have survived an emotionally abusive relationship, there is a good chance that you have had your own self esteem damaged in some way. The emotional abuser’s tactic is to make you feel like you are not good enough, and they are frequently quite good at this. The end result is that you frequently see yourself as damaged or not particularly valuable, and you may not even realize that you do this. You may put your needs last or simply ignore your needs altogether. You may find that you regularly tell yourself that you cannot do what you want to. You may self sabotage or procrastinate because you do not feel like you are capable. Alexithymia (an inability to identify emotions) This is a fancy word for an inability to accurately identify or feel your own emotions. Effectively, you become impervious to your emotions and instead live a life of numbness. You may have emotions, but you are entirely unaware that they are happening. Even though your body language will show your emotion, if someone asks you, you will deny it, saying that you do not actually feel that emotion. After so long of being emotionally abused and feeling your emotions, you have sort of disconnected from them. Depression Depression is a common long term effect of living in an emotionally abusive relationship simply due to the fact that you are not going to find that you are enjoying life and what you are doing if it is constantly shadowed by the abuse. Even after escaping, you may feel like you cannot find enjoyment. This may present itself as a sort of hopelessness in your life like things can never get better, or that you will always be miserable in your life. Struggling to Concentrate Another common effect of prolonged emotional abuse is the inability to concentrate well. This is often a side effect of depression and anxiety—you are too busy worrying about other things to actually concentrate on what is in front of you. Struggling to Sleep, or Sleeping too Much Commonly associated with depression, emotional abuse can leave you feeling too on edge to sleep at all, leading to insomnia, or it can lead to you sleeping more than you should be as a form of escapism to avoid facing reality. Anxiety A common side effect of living life feeling like everything that you do is being scrutinized is anxiety. When you have walked on eggshells for so long, your body naturally transitions to being in a default state of arousal and anxiety. This means that you are far more likely to suffer from it, even after escaping the situation. Chronic Pain A life lived with anxiety and depression often causes all sorts of physical problems as well, and you may find that you very quickly end up living with chronic pain. Even after going to doctors and getting testing, you find that there is no particular reason for the pain that you are feeling and it gets lumped in with your depression and anxiety. Emotional Abuse Tactics Emotional abusers have all sorts of tactics that they like to pull from to keep their victims firmly under their thumbs. These tactics can seem like they are not anything at all, such as finding ways to make disparaging comments under the guise of a joke, or they can be truly harmful, such as directly telling someone to hurt or kill themselves. These different forms of emotional abuse are all dangerous in their own ways, and you should be on the lookout for them whenever possible. Gaslighting Gaslighting is particularly insidious as a form of emotional abuse. It is designed to make you feel like you cannot trust yourself, making you feel like you are unstable, untrustworthy, and like you are going crazy. It is one of those techniques that usually takes plenty of time to set up, but once it is set up, you feel like you cannot escape it. When someone gaslights you, they deny that what you are saying is true. They may start out by telling you that you were wrong about something little or unimportant, such as saying that you are misremembering some small, insignificant detail about something. Over time, the details become more significant, and the abuser eventually denies the thing that happens right in front of you, and you feel like you have to believe them. Especially because at that point, there is a perceived pattern of always getting things wrong and feeling like you cannot possibly know what you are talking about, you simply take what your partner says at face value. Because you inherently trust your partner, you do not think that he or she would be trying to intentionally lie to you. Emotional Manipulation Emotional manipulation is the act of making you feel a certain emotion deliberately in order to get you to act accordingly. If they want you to do something for them, they will find some way to make you feel an emotion that is conducive to their desired response, and they then get their way. For example, if your partner does not like your sister, your partner may make it a point to tell you that your sister did something unforgivable to get you angry. With your anger, you then pick a fight with your sister to defend your partner, and you end up severing ties. Did that event that your partner said ever happen? Probably not, or at least, not the way that your partner made it sound, but your partner did get you to end the relationship without him having to be the one telling you that he wants you to. FOG FOG stands for Fear, Obligation, Guilt. It is a common form of emotional manipulation that keeps you feeling one of those three emotions to keep you under control. Unlike general emotional manipulation, however, when you are kept under FOG, your partner is doing something to maintain it. Your partner must have something held over you to make you feel obligated so that he or she can make you feel guilty in order to get the desired response from you. Because this is a bit more intensive, it is typically reserved for relationships like parents to children, simply because it is easy to lord over someone else that you birthed and raised them. However, a romantic partner or friend may not have something similar to hold over their victim’s head. Character Assassination Character assassination is the art of making you feel like you are a flawed individual in order to keep power over you. It may involve making it a point to control you via means such as telling you that you are always so difficult or that you never get anything right. It could involve telling you that you are worthless or useless. It could involve telling lies about you to other people as well. Ultimately, character assassination is done to make you seem less competent or less well liked. Especially if you are ending the relationship with the abuser, you may find that he or she will tell everyone around you that you are irrational, on drugs, or otherwise doing something that is incredibly frowned upon. Chapter 3: Fighting Emotional Abuse Emotional abuse is terrifying. No one wants to feel like they are less than significant or that they need to constantly walk on eggshells. If you are being emotionally abused, you may find that you are longing for the days of being happy, if you had ever felt that way in the past. You may have found that the abuse is terrifying. You may feel broken, beaten, or hopeless. It may seem like escape is impossible and that this will be your life forever. Remember, there is hope out there for you. It may take you time and effort to get out, but you can do it. You must remember that you will be playing the long game and acknowledge that the hard work will be worth it when you are finally living a life that you enjoy. You can attain that happiness that you deserve, and most of the time, you can cut off contact with your abuser in some way. Unless you share minor children, upon splitting ties or divorcing from the abuser, you have no reason to remain in contact. Yes, even if that relationship is with a parent, your own adult child, or another family member, you can break free and leave the relationship for good. However, that will take time. This chapter seeks to get you stabilized before you are able to begin getting out. Think of this chapter as your sort of safety floatation device—it is your first line of defense against drowning in the ocean of abuse you have been stranded in for so long. Hold on just a little bit longer, and you will find safety. Within this chapter, you will be provided with nine distinct methods that you can use to cope with your abuse in the moment. It is oftentimes impossible to simply up and leave for many people, and that is exactly why this chapter sets out to make sure that you are able to cope with the abuse before you can escape. It will be a process, but using these methods will help you find some sort of solace in the midst of the abuse. You will be actively protecting yourself, your psyche, and your future by planning to leave and using these methods. Keep in mind that these methods are specifically meant to combat emotional abuse. If you are suffering from physical abuse, you absolutely need to get out as soon as possible, and you can usually do so with the help of local law enforcement. If there is physical abuse, you should be able to file for a restraining order at your local courthouse or press charges at your local police station. Physical abuse can very quickly go downhill, so it is important that it is immediately met with an escape and any and all legal help that you can attain. When you are fighting emotional abuse, there is not typically a threat to your life or physical health, and these techniques will help you retain your emotional health. Emotional abuse requires you to react to it, so if you refuse to engage, distance yourself from the abuse, and have your own methods to sort of combat it as you get all of your legal ducks in a row, you can usually avoid the brunt of it. If you know that your partner is abusive emotionally and is telling you that you are useless from a point of wanting to manipulate you, you may be able to remind yourself that this is just your abuser being an abuser and that it is not true, or you can point out the ways that you are not worthless for yourself to acknowledge. Now, without further ado, let’s begin to address several ways that you can use to protect yourself. In arming yourself against the abuse, you may find that it stops being as distressing as it occurs, though it still may bother you. Identifying and Acknowledging The most powerful thing you can do is name the abuse for what it is. This means that you need to be able to acknowledge what it is and recognize it for what it is. In labeling the abuse what it is, you are able to distance yourself from it. It is no longer a matter of you causing problems or not being good enough—now your problem is that you are in a relationship with someone who is abusive. However, that has a relatively simple solution: Leaving. While leaving itself can oftentimes be quite messy and involve its own slew of steps to complete, especially if you are married or have children, being able to acknowledge that the problem is not you, after all, can be incredibly freeing. In acknowledging that you are not the problem or that you are not flawed, you are able to remove the blame from yourself. You are no longer at fault for the pain that you have suffered, and you are able to accurately point that blame firmly where it belongs—with the abuser. Think about the implications about that and the relief that many people would feel in acknowledging that they are not actually useless, unlovable, or whatever else the abuser has tried to convince them. With the blame removed, you may find that you are able to actually find some newfound confidence in yourself—if you are not the problem, then you have no need to fix yourself at that moment. What you need to do is leave the problem because you are not responsible for anyone else. No matter how well intentioned you may be, you cannot change other people in any way. You cannot convince your abuser to be the loving person that you thought he or she was—all you can do is know when it is appropriate to exit the relationship altogether. Preparing to Leave As soon as you have acknowledged the abuse in your relationship, it is time to make your long term plans. What are your end goals? What do you hope to accomplish? What do you want to do with yourself? There is a whole wide world out there away from your abuser, and the world is your oyster. You can do whatever you want without worrying about what the abuser thinks and whether the abuser would agree or ridicule your decisions. Setting that goal for yourself, that long term picture of success, can help yourself to stay motivated. In moments of weakness, and there will be moments of weakness during which you consider that things would be better if you forgave and forgot, you can remember this goal—this picture of what you want in life. That can be the guiding light that keeps you on track. Leaving the relationship is going to be the most dangerous part for you, and for this reason, it is going to require meticulous planning, especially if you have anything joining the two of you together legally. Children will almost always create legal complications during which you will either have to agree to custody or fight over custody, and you will then be looking at interacting with your ex for the rest of you children’s childhoods, as well as during major events in their lives if he happens to take an interest in them as well. For this reason, it is recommended that you spend enough time gathering your evidence. You are planning for the worst while hoping for the best. In particular, leaving has a lot of different nuances that need to be followed that would be incredibly difficult to properly cover in a subchapter, so while preparing to leave is absolutely a step in fighting emotional abuse at the moment, it will also get its own chapter later within the book. Chapter 9 will be dedicated to making sure that you know how to leave the relationship, guiding you through the most critical parts and what you need to make sure that you have. Avoid Triggering Abuse While you are present in the same home with the abuser, it is important to go through the effort of actively avoiding triggering any abuse. While it is normally never okay to expect the victim to accommodate the abuser, in this case, it can help you slip through the next weeks or months while you gather up everything that you will need and make your case just a bit easier. This means that you will need to understand what your partner’s triggers are. That can be a bit difficult to identify and may take a significant amount of time, but if you can do so, you avoid having to deal with as much of the abuse. If you wish to figure out your partner’s triggers, you will need to think back on all of the times that you have seen your partner explode on you. What has caused the explosion? Why did they do it? Can you see a pattern in constantly exploding with specific stimuli? Figuring out what tends to trigger the abuse can be enough to help you avoid most of the iterations of it. Perhaps the best way to avoid it is to simply be very agreeable. Do what is expected of you without argument. Think of it as keeping the peace until you can escape, treating it as a part of your long term plan rather than as a weakness on your part. There is nothing weak about being willing to accept what you are being told, no matter how degrading it is, in order to escape. Doing so is the epitome of strength, showing your true dedication as a survivor. You will survive the abuse, even if it means lowering yourself and being willing to not fight back for a short period of time. Stress Management Of course, being willing to take that abuse means that you will likely be quite stressed out as well. After all, having someone tell you that you cannot do anything right can be incredibly stressful. You may feel like you have done your best, only to have the narcissist or abuser come by and laugh in your face. Think of how a child feels after having spent an hour building a sandcastle, only to have it immediately kicked down by a bully. This is similar to the feelings you may have when you are actively trying your best, only to find that your abuser is willing to disparage your attempts. Of course, the narcissist or abuser just wants to get a rise out of you—if they are able to goad you into a response, telling you that you are terrible and that you need to stop trying because your attempts are never going to be salvageable anyway, they can then use your anger against you. You will play right into their trap rather than refusing to play the game at all. The best way to avoid having an outburst of your own in response is developing several stress management techniques that will work for you. Ultimately, this will involve discovering what works best for you. Do you do best with working out or going for a jog after being stressed out? Maybe you want to meditate? Do you enjoy art? All of that can help keep you cool over time. However, when you are in the moment, what you really need is a grounding technique that will help you stay present. Doing so can help you delay yourself and your behaviors just long enough that you will be able to avoid doing something that would potentially be dangerous. In particular, we will take a look at a simple breathing and grounding technique that will involve you utilizing all of your senses. When you are feeling stressed, you will want to identify several different sensory stimuli from your surroundings as you take deep breaths. Doing so can help you calm down enough to avoid lashing out. Start by taking in a deep breath. When you do this, you want to inhale for five seconds and exhale for five seconds to make sure that you are calming your body down. With your next breath, identify five things that you can see and acknowledge each consciously. You may see a houseplant, a toy that your child left on the floor, your cat, a chair, and the light that is on in the hallway. With the next breath, you will identify four things that you can hear around you. Then, it will be three items that you can touch. Two items that you can smell in the air, and lastly, one taste that is either in your mouth or lingering in the air. Going through these steps can help you calm yourself—it will distract you from the immediate surge of negativity that you have in response to abuse and allow you to keep a level head. Practice it on your own in private several times before you try to use it to keep yourself calm in the moment when you are actively being manipulated or abused. * Breathe deeply * Breathe deeply * Breathe deeply * Breathe deeply Self Care With all of the toxicity and negativity swirling around you as you endure the abuse, you may feel like you are dragging. What can help you is to actively engage in regular self care as a response. When you are constantly in survival mode, you will exhaust your body. You will constantly find yourself suffering from the negative effects of anxiety and stress hormones that constantly keep you on edge. When you never know where danger will strike next, it can be incredibly difficult to keep yourself safe. Create a routine that you can use to take care of yourself, even as stress feels like it may become insurmountable. When you do this, you are actively making it a point to care for yourself, as your partner has made it clear that he or she has no interest in helping you to heal or be a healthy individual. You will want to make it a point to do several things during your self care routine: Make sure that you get enough sleep regularly. This can be difficult, but make sure that you try to sleep at the same time every night, no matter how stressed you are about life. You want to be able to remain healthy. Keep yourself motivated to actively exercise on a regular basis and eat as healthily as you can. Beyond that, try to find time to care for yourself as well .Routine will be your friend, and actively scheduling in time for yourself, especially to do things that you enjoy, will be critical in keeping you on track and able to cope with the abuse that you may be enduring. Refusing to Engage When you do find that you are being caught in an actively abusive situation, such as your partner deciding then to begin berating you, the most important thing that you can do is refuse to engage. Simply try to tide it over as quickly as possible and agree if you have to. Just tell him okay to get him off your back and then go on with your life. Again, this is not a sign of weakness—you are making it a point to protect yourself from future abuse. You are actively guarding yourself and telling yourself that you are not willing to tolerate it. This is a good thing—you are showing true strength. While most people will usually advocate for a lie being left unchallenged becomes the truth, that is not necessarily true with the abusive partner. The lies are being told whether you are around or not anyway, and you are safer in not attempting to counter them at all. It becomes easier to simply agree and move on until you are free to escape. If you are not wanting to tolerate the abuse in the first place, you need to make it a point to focus on surviving long enough to escape. We are not talking about someone jokingly telling everyone that you happened to be the one who ate all of the cake in the workplace overnight or something else foolish—you are considering being berated and told that you are not worthy as an individual. Agreeing and moving on may get your abuser off your back sooner. Avoiding Personalization Of course, despite the fact that you are agreeing, you must keep in mind that you are avoiding actually internalizing it. Known as personalization, you may find that sometimes, it is hard not to take what the manipulator or abuser is saying personally. However, keep in mind that despite the fact that the abuser is saying this and despite the fact that the abuser is someone that you likely love, and it can be hard to hear your loved one telling you that you are nothing. Try to approach hearing this abuse the way that you would hear a child snapping at you—if your 4 year old child called you a butt face because you told your child to eat his veggies so he could go to bed, you would not live life believing that you actually have a butt for a face. Instead, you would probably shrug it off, roll your eyes about it behind your child’s back, and move on without actually taking any offense. Of course, an abuser is going to be flinging far worse insults most of the time. He may tell you that you are ugly, worthless, unlovable, or damaged goods. He may try to tell you that you are incredibly lucky that he has been so willing to look past your flaws to be with someone like you. You are lucky that he has actively been willing to put up with you when you are so dumb, incompetent, or careless. He will say this in a matter of fact tone that may have you tempted to believe it. However, remember that he is lying. He does not care about you. He does not want you to be happy—he wants you to be controlled, and he will use any methods necessary to get that end result. The best way to combat this is to simply stop playing. Let him say what he says, but then remind yourself that it is not true. Reject what he has to say and label it for what it is—an attempt to manipulate you and nothing more. If you can reject it as little more than an attempt to manipulate you, you will be able to avoid much of the stress that goes along with it. His emotional manipulation attempts become infinitely less powerful as soon as you remove the power away from them by refusing to allow them to upset you any longer. It will be tough. It may even hurt, but refusing to play and refusing to take it personally when the abuser spews his lies means that you will be able to escape and heal. Chapter 4: Recovering from Emotional Abuse When you have finally pulled the trigger and acknowledged that you have been in an abusive relationship, it can be hard to know what comes next. You may feel afraid or unsure of how to proceed. You may realize that you are broken inside, or that you have some serious healing to do. This is okay —you have just endured some serious emotional harm, and that takes time to recover from. First and foremost, once you have taken the plunge to leave an emotionally abusive relationship, you should celebrate your power —leaving a relationship is never easy, and even when you have been abused, you likely still have very real feelings for your ex. This is only natural. However, over time, you may feel like you are ready to branch out —that you want to find a new relationship and a new meaning to life. You may find at first that, without proper processing of your abuse, it will constantly come back to haunt you. You may find yourself struggling to trust other people, or feeling like the other shoe is going to drop at any time. You may suffer from anxiety or PTSD—you may suffer from flashbacks or insomnia. You may be sick and tired of the suffering, but not know how to stop it from continuing. When you have suffered from all of this abuse, you may feel like there will be no end to it. However, that end does exist—all you need to do is find it. You can reclaim your life and begin to heal those wounds that you have accrued from your time with an abusive partner. It is not necessarily quick, nor is it easy, but there are actions and steps that you can take to help you recover from emotional abuse, little by little. You may find that it helps to think of this process one day at a time. If one day seems like it is too much to process, try thinking of it like one hour at a time, or even one minute or second at a time if you find that you are feeling particularly sensitive at that point in time. You will inevitably feel moments of weakness during which you want nothing more than to give in and go back to your abuser. This is common—it may be easier to be with the abuser. It may be more familiar and therefore, more comfortable. It may even be that you find that you miss your past and the times during which you and your partner were happy. However, steel your resolve and keep moving forward. You cannot stop an abuser from abusing. This chapter will act as a guide for you to begin to recover from the abuse that you have suffered. Little by little, if you can implement these techniques into your life, and you can follow the steps, you will find that your wounds slowly begin to heal. They may leave their scars, but the injuries will no longer be festering. Take Time to Grieve It can be disconcerting for abuse victims to realize that they do truly miss their abusers even after having suffered at their hands, whether physically or emotionally. However, this is normal. You are grieving the loss of a relationship. You are effectively giving up on the relationship that you thought that you had. You are giving up on the person that you thought you loved, who you may still deeply love, but who did not love or respect you. This can be one of the hardest things you will ever do—you find that you cannot possibly live your life healthily and happily if you do not leave your partner, but you know that leaving your partner will also hurt. It is appropriate to take the time that you find that you need to grieve. Spend the time acknowledging the hurt that you feel and the pain that you have endured. It was not your fault, nor did you deserve it, but that does not make the process any easier. Grief comes in seven distinct stages: shock and denial, pain and guilt, anger and bargaining, depression, the upward turn, reconstruction, and finally, acceptance. These stages are not all linear—you may make progress only to find that a significant event or an anniversary passes and sends you right back to denial or anger. This is normal, and remember that no two people grieve the same way. What remains true, however, is that if you find that your guilt is so overwhelming that you cannot function properly or get through your days, or you find that you are coping unhealthily, it may be time to seek help from a trusted friend or family member, or from a professional that can take the time to talk to you and help you get the tools that you will need. Pain and guilt i a Bt Anger and Jepression P bargaining The upward onstruction tum Acceptance Reclaim Your Life Because emotional abusers so frequently try to take over your life and turn it into their own, making sure that you are obedient and willing to do whatever it takes to please them, you may find that you have lived much of your life losing your time and your life. This means that you have spent weeks, months, or even years sacrificing your time, your desires, and things that you may have wanted to try, all in the name of the relationship. A healthy way to begin to heal from that, from having to sacrifice yourself, your desires, and your happiness, is to reclaim it. Reclaim your time— spend it doing what you want to do. Eat that cake that would have gotten you a disapproving look. Spend time with that friend that your ex hated. Chase after that passion that you had thrown aside after your ex had told you that it was a pipe dream. This may tough to do, especially if you have found that you really suffered within your relationship or if you were regularly punished for doing anything for yourself. However, the best way to ensure that you can reclaim your life for yourself and begin to heal is simply by doing it. Flex those self care muscles and get back into your hobbies. Reach out to those friends and family members that were cast aside. Find new ways to live your life for yourself, and follow through. While it will be difficult at first, you will very quickly fall back into the habit of reclaiming life for yourself and loving every moment of it. Now, this does not mean that you will necessarily be entirely stress free, or that you have healed completely, but you will start to undo those strings installed that told you that you cannot possibly live for yourself. Create Your Boundaries—and Enforce Them Oftentimes, those who are abused feel like they cannot have boundaries, or they do not know how to enforce any boundaries that they do set. They may have always been entirely disregarded, so you feel like they do not matter anyway, or you may have been punished or made to feel crazy any time that you attempted to set a boundary, so it became simpler to instead reject the idea of having those boundaries at all. However, boundaries are healthy. They are normal and expected in most normal relationships. These boundaries are your way of marking that you will only tolerate certain behaviors and that anything beyond those behaviors will be deemed inappropriate and not welcomed by you. For example, a normal and healthy boundary to have is to not accept name calling. You may have a boundary of not being called names, and if anyone were to call you names, you would take a step back and reevaluate that relationship altogether. That is a healthy response to such abuse, and no one would bat an eye at it. However, your abusive ex may have made you feel like setting a reasonable boundary like that is problematic to your relationship or that it means that you do not trust or love your partner. This is not true—even marriages have boundaries, and those boundaries keep the relationship healthy. When you set your boundaries, you are telling other people that you respect yourself enough to not tolerate disrespect. You tell those around you that you care about yourself and that you will not be made to feel less significant or unworthy. You declare that you will protect yourself and not let yourself fall for abuse again. What is important here is that you set those boundaries and enforce them as well. Put distance between yourself and those who want to break your boundaries. If people want to repeatedly stomp all over those boundaries that you have set, then you are probably better off without those people in your life. Even if the person that is constantly breaching your boundary is a family member or a loved one, you are well within your rights to end the relationship and take a huge step back. Remember, if those around you truly loved you, they would respect your boundaries, and anyone who is willing to stomp all over what you want or need does not truly care for you. Forgive Yourself No, this does not mean you should forgive your abuser. However, you are deserving of forgiveness from yourself. What you went through was not okay, and you never should have had to live a life being abused. You did not deserve what happened to you. However, do not waste your time feeling guilty for remaining in that situation for too long. Instead, put your energy toward forgiving yourself. Remember that forgiveness and forgetting are not the same things—you have absolutely learned from the past and just through reading this book right now, you are putting in the effort to do better in the future. You are making it a point to learn how best to protect and defend yourself, and in doing so, you promise yourself that you will take better care of yourself. However, you still deserve to forgive yourself. You did not ask to be abused. You did not know that the relationship would end up the way that it did. You did not know that your partner would slowly become a monster wearing his mask, nor did you ever want to be in that position in the first place. No one wants to be abused, and it is incredibly easy to overlook those early warning signs, reminding yourself that you love your partner and that it must have been a one time deal. You tell yourself that it will not happen again, and then you find yourself trapped in the cycle of abuse. Nevertheless, you have committed to living a better life. You have left the relationship, and that says that you are committed to bettering yourself. Let go of the guilt that you have been feeling toward yourself, and forgive yourself once and for all. You are not disregarding or forgetting the abuse— you are simply choosing to no longer let it rule your life. You are acknowledging that you did not deserve it. You are acknowledging that you did not ask for it. You are acknowledging that your ex was the one with the problem. Above all, you are acknowledging that you have broken free and making a promise to yourself that it will never happen again. Reclaim Your Narrative When you were in the midst of your relationship, you likely found that your relationship and your ex were constantly changing the narrative that you lived by. Not only were you constantly being told that you were wrong about what was happening, but you were likely also blamed for the abuse that you endured on a regular basis. You may have been told that you were to blame when the abuser lost his or her cool. You may have been told that you are a magnet for the abuse. You may have been told that whatever happened was not abusive. Now is the time to reclaim that narrative. No longer do you have to live by the abuser’s doctrine. You can determine what has happened for yourself and make sure that you tell yourself the truth. You are no longer bound to do whatever the abuser has told you to do. You no longer have to make it a point to agree with the abuser just to make sure that you do not suffer further. When you finally reclaim the narrative, you are able to define what has actually happened. You get to tell the story from your own perspective, acknowledging that you were abused and that you never deserved it. You can point out all the ways that your ex tried to force you to give in to the narrative that the abuser tried to tell everyone, and you can finally tell other people the truth. When you reclaim your story, you are effectively taking back the power. You are telling yourself that the abuser no longer has that control over you. You are making it clear that your life’s story is your own and that what happened was horrendous, but you are able to protect yourself further. You can correct the record. You are rejecting the abuser’s attempt to keep you silent, and you are rejecting the constant gaslighting. This is perhaps the most personal of the steps toward emotional recovery— you are acknowledging what has happened for what it is. You are choosing to make it clear to yourself, and to anyone that you choose to share it with, that you did not deserve what happened. Remember that this is your own story, and you do not have to share it if you chose not to. While some people find it empowering to share that story with others, you may choose to keep it to yourself, and that is okay. Seek Professional Help There are very few people in this world that would not benefit from some sort of guidance from a licensed psychologist at one point or another in their life. If you have been suffering from abuse, you may find that getting this help is actually imperative to your healing. When you get help from someone else, you are able to be given the coping mechanisms that you will need to truly begin to heal from abuse. There is nothing inherently wrong with seeing a therapist, though there is still quite the stigma around it. You are not going out of your way to find a crutch, and you are not necessarily seeking out medication. However, what you are doing is figuring out how to move forward in life and heal. Would you judge someone with a giant gash on their arm for going to the doctor for stitches? Would you tell someone with a broken foot to walk it off and stop being such a wimp? Probably not—and you should look at a mental health issue in the same way. If you have just escaped an emotionally abusive relationship, there is no doubt about it—you likely have emotional injuries. These wounds cannot begin to heal until you clean them out, and therapy can provide the skills necessary to do exactly that. You can learn how to better cope with your emotions, how to undo the emotional damage, and how to begin to better yourself. All of this comes together, and you can begin to heal once and for all. There are several different types of therapy that you can try in order to heal yourself. You may choose to seek out a therapist that is of the same religion as you. You may choose to investigate traditional psychotherapy, in which you talk over your feelings and thought processes over an extended period of time to try to come to some sort of resolution. You may choose to try Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), a type of therapy that is commonly used to help veterans with their PTSD over a relatively short period of time. A commonly used therapy that you may find beneficial is cognitive behavioral therapy. This is a therapy that seeks to combine the best of cognitive therapy and behavioral therapy into a form of treatment that addresses both your thoughts and your behaviors to help you heal. Within this therapy type, you will be given several different tools to help you identify, restructure, and change your ways of thinking in order to directly influence your behaviors. This works through acknowledging the cycle of thoughts, influencing your feelings, which influence your behaviors. When you change just one in that cycle, you are able to create a domino effect that changes it all. Through providing actionable coping mechanisms, such as creating affirmations, learning the process of cognitive restructuring, and other similar tools, you will be prepared to handle nearly any problem with the tools provided. This means that you will not only be able to finally address your own trauma associated with the abusive relationship; you will also begin to heal whatever made you vulnerable to that abuse in the first place. You will learn how to prevent yourself from becoming a victim in the future. You will learn to be the best you can be. Chapter 5: The Narcissistic Abuser Addressing the emotional abuser is always a struggle, but at the very least, the emotional abuser is usually aware of his actions. The narcissistic abuser, on the other hand, can sometimes be even more persistent, more dangerous, and more insidious than the emotional abuser. The narcissist is driven to abuse by a personality disorder, whereas the emotional abuser may not be, and that is one of the major differences there Emotional abusers tend to abuse because they want to be powerful. They abuse because they want to be strong. They abuse because they want control. The narcissistic abuser, on the other hand, is different. The narcissistic abuser is driven by personality shortcomings and simply not being able to help himself. He cannot help the fact that he has a tendency to abuse, and even worse, his personality type prevents him from ever acknowledging that he may have been the root of the problem all along. Narcissistic individuals are incredibly needy. They demand attention and conformity at all times, and the mere notion that they may not get what they had originally wanted. What is interesting is that narcissistic abuse tends to follow the exact same patterns, no matter where you go. It may even seem that people that are subject to narcissistic abuse feel like everyone has read the same books. Two people who have suffered at the hands of two separate narcissists can almost always come together and nod sagely as they listen to what the other has to say about their experience. While emotional abusers are capable of change, and people of all kinds can show signs of emotional abuse at some time, such as yelling at someone to shut up in the heat of the moment, the narcissist does not. The narcissist is someone that can never change due to their personality type. They are disordered by nature—that is to say that they never think about the world in the way that an ordinary person would. There is too much lacking in the narcissistic personality type to allow for meaningful change or even the acknowledgment that the narcissist’s victim was even human enough to matter. At the end of the day, the emotional abuser is, at the very least a real person. As you are about to see, the narcissist is not. The narcissist hides behind a mask that is used to shield his true self from ever seeing the light of day, and this can add a whole new level of struggle to recovering from the emotional abuse that the narcissist naturally emanates. He does not mean to do this—it comes naturally to him. However, knowing that it was a natural intention of a disordered individual, little more than a delusional attempt to draw the victim in, does nothing for the victim in terms of healing. In fact, learning that the individual that the victim loved and knew was a lie all along can be particularly traumatizing on its own. Within this chapter, we will walk through what narcissistic personality disorder entails in order to get a complete understanding of what it is. We will look at how the narcissist tends to present himself to the world, particularly looking at the difference between the covert, over, and malignant narcissists and how they all interact with each other. We will take the time to go over what it is that the narcissist looks for in a target, and finally, we will begin to unpack the unmitigated disaster of disorganization that is the narcissist’s mind and abuse. Narcissistic Personality Disorder Narcissistic personality disorder is named for the myth of Narcissus, who was said to fall in love with his own reflection after having rejected the advances of a young nymph named Echo. She was so devastated by his rejection that she faded away, giving us the source of the echo that you would hear if you were to yell something in the mountains. This gives most people the impression that the narcissist is someone vain and self loving, but not particularly dangerous. Narcissistic tendencies can be seen in annoying characters in media, for example, who dote needlessly over their own image. However, there is far more to NPD than simply admiring one’s reflection. Those suffering from NPD typically present with several traits that come together to create someone that lacks empathy strongly considers his or her own self more important than others and typically requires a constant and excessive need of admiration to feel validated and like he matters. He is not comfortable in his own skin unless he is able to gain the attention and admiration from others. NPD is known as a cluster B personality disorder—these are disorders that directly impact one’s ability to interact socially and is found alongside those with histrionic personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, and antisocial personality disorder. All four of these types of disorders are particularly known for their dramatics and unpredictability. In particular, they are usually quite emotional and difficult to manage, and because the very way that they see the world has been so incredibly skewed, they struggle to ever actually recognize that they may actually have some sort of problem. With NPD in particular, you will see several symptoms, of which five must be present to be clinically diagnosable. These symptoms must arise in several different contexts over several different times, showing that they are pervasive in both recurrence and situation. The symptoms in particular that you can expect the clinically diagnosed narcissist to show include: a grandiose sense of self importance, self esteem that must be validated by the actions of other people, exploitative behavior, hurtful behavior, a lack of empathy, a focus on power and success, the assumption of being unique, a sense of entitlement, and a fixation with perfection. perfection Obsession S with Exploit ative Lack of empathy Fixated on fantasies of power Needfor Delusion of admiration uniqueness NPD exists with people who assume that they are perfect, with delusions on how they deserve respect and power, and they then go out of their way to exploit others to get that power. They are entirely convinced that they are entitled to anything and everything that they want because they are so unique and perfect. They feel like no one around them can possibly relate to who they are or understand the struggles of being as incredibly high class as the narcissist, and because of that, they typically spend as little time as possible with people that they deem to be beneath them. They would rather only associate with people that they see as their equals, meaning that anyone beneath them is only meant to be used and abused. The Narcissist What makes the narcissist so incredibly dangerous then, is the fact that the narcissist is not interested in interacting with other people unless they are his equal. Any relationships that he fosters will either be with people that he, himself, admires, or that he feels like he can use in some way. Effectively, either way has the same result—he is able to gain something out of his relationship. He sees the relationship as purely a stepping stone, drawing from traditional Machiavellian logic, but unlike the Machiavellian, the narcissist is likely to make mistakes. The narcissist believes that because he is so perfect and always right, that he does not have to be as careful as the other people. While still meticulous, he is going to ultimately do what he wants, when he wants, because he feels like he is entitled to doing exactly that. He would prefer to be able to act in ways that he sees to be beneficial to him. He wants to use people to his own enjoyment or to fill his excessive need for attention, something known as the narcissistic supply. At the end of the day, the narcissist will seek out valid forms of supply from other people, and depending on the type of narcissist that you are dealing with, you may see very different iterations of how they will go out of their way to get what they want. The overt narcissist is the one that everyone thinks of—he is grand and loud, demanding, and expectant. He feels that he is entitled to anything that he may want, and he will get it in any way necessary to ensure that he is satisfied. This is the one who believes that he is the best gift to mankind, even if everyone is just barely tolerant of him as an individual. He does not care about whether or not he is liked—all that matters to him is his success and the admiration that he wants. The covert narcissist is almost the exact opposite in many ways—the covert narcissist wants to be legitimately liked. He genuinely wants to be the best that there is, rather than simply believing that he is, but he struggles with his own emotional regulation. While the grandiose narcissist knows that he is the best, the covert narcissist needs that validation from other people in order to get it. The covert narcissist’s self esteem is entirely dependent upon how other people around him see him at that moment, and if he is not being showered in attention, he feels unworthy and will oftentimes play the victim role in order to get that attention that he desires. Finally, the malignant narcissist is the scariest of them all. Unlike the other two, who simply want to be validated and admired, the malignant narcissist just wants attention. He is typically quite sadistic as well, meaning that he enjoys watching other people suffer in misery. This means that he may find great joy out of intentionally setting up situations that will end in disasters, just to watch it all play out. He enjoys hurting people just for fun, intentionally making relationships fall apart, taking challenges such as convincing someone to fall head over heels in love with him before discarding them like garbage, and more. All he cares about is enjoying himself in any way. Recognizing the narcissist, no matter what the form, can generally be quite difficult for one reason: The narcissist’s personality is constantly changing. If you have ever seen a narcissist go from person to person, it can be incredibly eerie just how differently the interactions become from person to person. The narcissist may be a fun sports loving personality with one person, only to shift into reserved and analytical with the next. The finesse with which he can shift personalities with ease is incredibly daunting. However, this is what makes his abuse particularly painful to tolerate. The Narcissist’s Target Before discussing the methods of abuse, however, it is imperative that you understand the various personality types that become the narcissist’s preferred targets. Just as the narcissist has a set type of behaviors that seem to occur no matter who the narcissist is, they all tend to share an incredibly similar personality preference for their long term victims. The victims that are going to be pursued for long term relationships are ones that are going to e relatively easy to subdue. Narcissists are particularly lazy when it comes to their relationships with other people, and because of that, they will choose the path of least resistance wherever possible. They will intentionally decide to work toward a relationship with someone who they think will be easy to manage just so they always shave easy access to the narcissistic supply that they desire. In particular, there seem to be five distinct personality traits that attract the narcissist, and the best way to sum them all up into one word would be to call the target codependent. While the target may not always be codependent, they will show several signs of codependency and have enough of the features that the narcissist will not have to work too hard. The traits that the narcissist seems to favor most of all are people that are empathetic, who has had a rocky upbringing, are caregivers by nature, are conflict avoidant, have low self esteem, and are naturally people pleasers. These five traits come together to create a person that is well suited to tend to the narcissist’s every whim and need. Dysfunctional upbringing The NMarcissist’s Prey An empathetic individual is going to be able to relate to the narcissist or think that he or she can, and in relating, the empathetic individual will feel more inclined to help. They will want to help the narcissist, seeing someone that is broken, but who can be fixed with compassion and care. The empathy of the individual typically goes hand in hand with the caregiver nature of the narcissist’s target. Because they want to help other people at any cost, they will diligently put in the time and effort to tending to the narcissist’s needs. This leads the narcissist to getting that supply fix that he wanted, even though over time, it becomes too much for the empathetic one to take. By ensuring that the natural target of the narcissist is also conflict avoidant after having grown up in dysfunction, the narcissist is able to net a target that is far less likely to notice the red flags in their relationship. Abusive tendencies, such as emotional manipulation, will not seem as alarming when the individual that is being manipulated has grown up around similar abuse. Effectively, the empathetic target has never built up a solid boundary between abuse and a healthy relationship, and because of that, met with the fact that the target is likely a people pleaser that wants to avoid conflict, the target will simply take the abuse without a word. Targets like this are commonly deemed codependent—a term that implies that they are enabling the narcissist’s abusive tendencies. The codependent is effectively the opposite of the narcissist: He or she will have a need to feel needed, in perfect contrast to the narcissist’s need for admiration. If the narcissist wants to feel wanted and the codependent wants to feel needed, you would think that the two are a natural match made in heaven. However, there is one particular problem with this match—the narcissist will continue to take until the codependent eventually burns out. The codependent is so entirely dependent upon the relationship for any sort of validation in life that she may not realize just how much she is giving up, or recognize that the harm being done is truly problematic. The narcissist should not be able to override any and all needs for the codependent, and yet that is exactly what happens. The codependent’s need for feeling like she is helping other people then prevents her from ever actually taking care of herself. The codependent tends to be someone who has already grown up with his or her needs being marginalized in favor of someone else—this means that she is not likely to care or notice much about her own needs being forgone in favor of the narcissist. She will simply see it as life as usual and continue on her way without a second thought. While the codependent and the narcissist absolutely do meet those needs for each other, this is perhaps one of the more toxic combinations of personality types—the narcissist is effectively enabled, allowing for further justification of the abuse and control that he feels the need to exhibit. The codependent continues to define her own self worth as being entirely dependent upon the narcissist’s need of her. In the end, the two bring out the worst for each other by meeting their most desired need in a way that is harmful for all involved. They become a toxic relationship, in which they are both incredibly dangerous toward each other. These relationships rarely actually pan out particularly well as they end in burnout and further abuse. Identifying Narcissistic Abusers Narcissistic abuse harms everyone involved, and because it is so incredibly harmful to people, it is imperative that you understand what to look for in order to know what to avoid. Narcissistic abusers, however, are notoriously difficult to identify. Because they are commonly able to shift from personality to personality, changing their presented personas more often than teenage girls change their outfits, it can be incredibly difficult to keep track of who is the narcissist and what they look like. Thankfully, there is a method that you can use to identify the narcissistic abuser once you have had some time to interact with the other person. Because narcissists can be so incredibly persistent and are so dangerous and difficult to deal with as the mask comes off, avoidance is usually the best policy, but it is not always easy to avoid someone if you do not know what you are doing. Because of this, it is important that you learn to identify the narcissist early on. In learning to identify the narcissist, the next time you believe that someone may be one, you can instead choose to avoid them altogether instead of attempting to interact with them. The method that you will be using to identify the narcissist involves three simple steps—you will look at how they talk to you, you will look at how what they say makes you feel, and then you will identify how they are behaving. Each of these steps, if you spend the time to look at each, will help provide that valuable insight into whether or not they are a narcissist or other incredibly negative personality What they do What they say When you are paying attention to what the narcissist has to say, you are going to be looking for words that either come across as far too positive or far too negative. Either end of the spectrum bodes ill for the individual’s status as a stable individual. If you hear strongly positive words, you may be showered in affection and praise—however, this praise will be far more than is considered normal. It will err on the side of excessive, such as telling the victim that they are the center of the narcissist’s universe, or that the narcissist promises to make the victim his queen. This excessively positive, lavish speech is a warning to you that he is building you up. While it is normal to hear words of affection and admiration from a partner, if they can go on and on about how loved you are, they may simply be trying to win you over for their own gain. This is known as love bombing and will be discussed further in the narcissist’s tactics. On the other hand, strongly negative words imply that the individual is quite negative—they may talk down about other people around them, or point out that their boss is a terrible person. They act as though they are better than everyone that they are discussing. This should be treated as a red flag—if you were ever to stand up against the narcissist, you would be lumped into this category as well. Sometimes, the words of the narcissist show that there is no empathy involved—they will talk and act like you are not there, or respond to your own struggles. If they seem entirely impervious to emotions or relating to you when you talk about having a tough time, you are likely to struggle in future interactions and conversations. Finally, one last common tactic of the narcissist’s words is to use words that paint them as a victim—while the narcissist is convinced that he is superior to all, he will also inevitably suffer from what is referred to as a narcissistic injury—this is when the narcissist’s idea of perfection is challenged in some way, such as the narcissist not getting that promotion he was gunning for. When this happens, they are suddenly the victim—they will make it sound like it was an intentional slight rather than something that was decided upon because the person who was hired was actually competent and deserving. What you feel After having spent the time to listen to their words, you want to know how they make you feel as well. This will involve you identifying how you tend to feel when exposed to the other party, such as wondering if you happen to feel normal. Sometimes, the narcissist will intentionally make you feel either incredibly positively or incredibly negatively—usually, it will oscillate between the two. What is incredibly common, however, is the feeling of a lack of control. In the presence of the narcissist, the narcissist controls it all. They choose what they do, how they do it, and how you will feel. They will micromanage everything in order to get their own desired results, and if you attempt to fight them on it, they will do everything in their power to make you as miserable as possible. This is because they feel like they deserve to be right and respected—they want to be in utter control of everything around them. When you realize that you often feel like you are floating on cloud 9, you may be in the presence of a narcissist. While it is great that you feel so good, it is also worth wondering if the endless flattery and affection that you are getting is designed to hurt you. Sometimes, it is legitimate, but far more often, it is malicious and deliberate in order to control you. On the other hand, if you find that you regularly feel like you are not good enough or like nothing you do will ever be good enough, it may be time to wonder if the other person is a narcissist. They will often spend so much time talking about themselves, their own achievements, and how they would like to reach their own goals, they usually unintentionally put you down instead. They compare you and them without thinking about it—but the narcissist thinks he is the greatest gift on earth, so of course, he is going to sing himself high praises while simultaneously brushing you off as mediocre at best. What they do Finally, you want to figure out the narcissist’s behavioral habits as well. The narcissist is rarely ever actually considerate of the time of anyone other than the people that the narcissist believes are his equals or superiors. Anyone else can wait, and it does not matter how annoyed the other person is. They will usually end up quite insensitive and rude, but if you ever try to call out the behaviors, you get shrugged off like it does not matter. This is the nature of the narcissist—he does not care about other people. He will make a quick excuse or will attack you if you try to call him out, as narcissists tend to be particularly volatile when they are interacting with someone else, and they will then blow off their responsibility. They will find some way to be the victim, whether because you so rudely accused them or because they do not care about what they have done and how it impacts others. At the end of the day, if you find that the person seems to behave like a narcissist, using extreme words, triggering extreme feelings, and constantly quick to anger and willing to deflect blame, you may find that you are better off running in the other direction as quickly as possible. While it may be tempting when you see how charming that the narcissist comes off as, or when you hear the flattery that the narcissist gives you, remember that it is never worth the hassle, and you are generally better off giving up and avoiding the situation altogether. You will be happier without wasting your time trying to keep up with the mind games. Chapter 6: Narcissistic Abuse Finally, with that image in mind of how the narcissist presents himself and why the narcissist does what he does, you will be able to better understand the abuse that the narcissist is willing to inflict on other people. It will become important for you to recognize not only the warning signs of narcissistic abuse, which are a bit different than those reserved for emotional abuse, but also make sure that you are able to recognize several of the most common narcissistic abuse tendencies. This chapter will focus solely on teaching you about narcissistic abuse. You will be given guides to what the abuse is, how it works, why it is harmful, and why it is favored. More about fighting the narcissist’s abuse will happen in Chapter 8: Disarming the narcissist, in which you will be given several strategies for countering the narcissist in the moment in order to avoid allowing the narcissist to walk all over you any longer than he will otherwise try. With the successful understanding of these methods of abuse, you will be able to recognize when the abuse is occurring, allowing you to combat it if you have found yourself in a situation in which you cannot simply cut off or avoid the narcissist, which will always be the easiest, most efficient method of avoiding the harm that comes along with them. Signs of Narcissistic Abuse Narcissistic abuse is particularly insidious. It is designed to control and coerce, much like many of the emotional manipulation tactics, but beyond that, narcissistic abuse is powerful because oftentimes, the narcissist is not even aware of the abuse as it occurs. They simply go about their lives without self awareness or social awareness to understand what they are doing or how it impacts others. They are effectively slaves to their emotions, making them particularly dangerous. If you are constantly giving in to your emotional state, you are likely going to be making some particularly dangerous decisions that can absolutely ruin your chances of success as you wish to see it. When you are being exposed to narcissistic abuse, you will feel like your whole world has been turned upside down. It will be like nothing makes sense anymore, and like you cannot tell right from wrong. Imagine that you have just been spun over and over again until you are dizzy, and then you are thrown into the water with a blindfold. How do you figure out which way is up or down if you cannot touch the bottom of the water? The answer is, you can’t. The same thing happens with narcissistic abuse. Without guidance and understanding the signs of abuse, you can feel like that person in the water without any visual input or sensory input to help guide them to the surface. Of course, if they mistakenly swim downward instead of upwards, there may be some serious problems that could be fatal. While narcissistic abuse is not particularly likely to kill you, as it is primarily psychological in nature, it can leave you doubting yourself, your reality, and everything that you know. In particular, when you want to identify that you are actively being victimized by narcissistic abuse, it will once again be time for self reflection. While narcissistic abuse itself can get tricky to identify, the signs of the abuse in the victim are much more prominent, and if you know what you are looking for and can identify them, you can say quite confidently that you have been victimized by emotional or narcissistic abuse. As before, you will need to think about yourself as you go through this section. See how much of the signs of emotional predation from the narcissist seem to resonate with you, and if you find that you can strongly relate to the signs being provided, it is time to begin looking long and hard at your relationships to find the narcissist hiding in human clothing. Dissociation and Narcissistic Abuse One such symptom of narcissistic abuse is the experience of dissociation. This is effectively your mind’s way of separating the abuse from yourself— you will feel emotionally, and sometimes even physically detached from your body and mind. This is essentially the experience of a traumatic event —your mind tries to cope by separating away from the abuse and trauma in order to survive, or at the very least to no longer suffer. It is common knowledge that prey animals will suddenly freeze and stop moving when they are hunted and caught—this is likely quite similar in response. They freeze and dissociate so they do not suffer, and in doing so, they are detached from what has happened. When you have this happen to yourself, you may find that you are largely numb as an individual. Your emotions do not seem so important or meaningful to you anymore, and instead, you feel nothing at all. Of course, this is no way to live your life. You should be able to enjoy your life, which means you must be able to get rid of the traumatic aspect. Unmet Needs Another common sign that you are suffering from narcissistic abuse is that you lack the ability to meet your needs, or you chose not to. If you find that you have several unmet needs and wants building up, you may want to consider if these are unmet simply because you have not had time or resources, or because you have instead chosen to stop attempting to achieve what you have always wanted in favor of making sure that you cater to a narcissist in your life. Your Physical Health is Failing The mind and body are closely linked, and if you are suffering from anxiety or depression as a direct result of the narcissistic abuse that you have been enduring, you may find that your body itself may begin to get sick as well. Your body is effectively being flooded with stress hormones from the constant turmoil, and that constant stress leads to your body wearing down as well. That stress puts unnecessary wear on your heart and keeps you from sleeping, which wears down your immune system as well. If you find that you may be getting sicker more often than you used to, it is possible that a narcissist is to blame, especially in tandem with several other of the symptoms within this section. If you are getting sicker, do not try to brush it off as unrelated—your mind and body work together, and just because the narcissist may never lay a hand on you, his abuse can still cause significant physical harm. You Distrust Everyone As your body fails you and you find that you are largely miserable most of the time, you may also realize that along with the numbness comes this sense of not being able to trust others—you feel like you cannot trust that other people will not also be trying to hurt and abuse you, especially after coming to the conclusion that you are being abused in the first place. Knowing that someone that you loved was actually a monster in disguise can be incredibly earth shattering for the individual going through it. Effectively, you are not only dealing with the fact that you were lied to and abused, but you are also suddenly mourning the loss of a person that you thought you knew that never existed in the first place. That is particularly traumatic, and if you do not address that trauma, you are likely going to continue to struggle with trusting other people. You Protect the Narcissist Without Knowing Why And the fact that you do it may drive you insane. You do not know why you are protecting the narcissist, but it feels natural. This is because those in abusive relationships tend to rationalize, minimize, and then deny the abuse that was endured. Though you may be cognitively aware of the abuse that you are enduring, you must also recognize that the abuse is also leading you to protect the abuser. It is incredibly common for abuse victims to tell themselves that the abuse and abuser are not so bad—it is the only way that they can cope with the abuse as it occurs. If they admitted that the abuse was as bad as it truly was, they would be stuck with the cognitive dissonance of not getting out when they need to as they continue to be abused. It becomes easier for the mind to simply push away the abuse and pretend that it was not as bad as it actually was. However, think about the implication there—if you are minimizing the abuse, you are delegitimizing your own experience. You are saying that you are okay taking the abuse because it was not abusive in the first place. You are effectively burying your head and pretending that everything is fine because you cannot see what is happening, though it is clearly happening, and you are, at least to some degree, fully aware of it. Ask yourself, though, if you would tell your son or daughter to do what you are doing. If it were your child in your position, would you encourage your child that the abuse was not so bad or would you tell your child to break free and enjoy life? When you must identify whether or not you have been enduring the abuse of the narcissist, you are going to want to consider each of the previously listed traits. Do you feel an incessant need to protect the narcissist? Do you feel like the abuse is not actually as bad? Do you find that your health is worsening, or that you are living with constant anxiety? Are you simply numb constantly in between those bursts of numbness? This is a particularly painful realization to come to, knowing that you have been victimized, but it is so incredibly important. You need to be able to acknowledge if you have been hurt so you can prioritize healing. In knowing that you have been abused, you can start making an effort to prevent it from happening again in the future. You will be able to fight back, cleaning up your life, and finding the best way to work toward the life that you know that you deserve. You will be able to achieve that life with ease if you give yourself the time to do so. Now, it is time to delve into the narcissist’s favorite tactics to use and abuse other people. As you continue reading from this point on, you will gain special insight into what and why the narcissist does what he does. In particular, we are addressing some of the most prevalent manipulation tactics that the narcissist will make a part of his own toolkit. You will be walked through mirroring—the art of the narcissist changing who he presents himself as in order to win favor. You will then see how the narcissist is able to keep those relationships with love bombing and devaluation. You will look at gaslighting, the art of convincing people of things that are not actually true. You will see projection and how the narcissist loves to deflect his own flaws onto other people. You will see how the narcissist is able to so expertly reverse roles and somehow always end up as the victim—but only the best victim that has had it way worse than anyone else in the history of victimhood. Mirroring and the Narcissist You may have heard the term mirroring before—usually, it is used in the context of discussing neuro linguistic programming. However, here, we are talking about an entirely different type of mirroring. The narcissist has a special kind of mirroring, during which he is able to project exactly which personality he thinks will be necessary to win favor from the person that is meant to be manipulated one way or the other. When the narcissist is going to be mirroring someone, he first focuses on who his target is. Let’s say that we have our narcissist, Ned, and his target, a young woman named Talia. Ned sees Talia and immediately decides that she will be his next target. He goes over to her, the perfect picture of charisma and charm, and begins to talk. He makes a quick judgment call— based on her clothing, she is into country lifestyles, and he discusses how he has been dying to go horseback riding. It turns out that his guess was exactly right. She begins to talk about how she used to go with her late fiancé and discusses how her fiancé had been the kindest, gentlest soul she had ever seen. He then decides that what she needs is someone kind and gentle. Ned is constantly feeding off of the cues that Talia is giving, putting together the perfect picture of what she seems to want and need. He appears to be sensitive and interested in listening, despite the fact that he does not actually care about her or what she is saying—he pays only enough attention to make sure that he has enough information to use later on. Effectively, then, Ned will create a persona—a sort of mast that he uses to present himself to Talia, over the course of the introduction and interaction. He figures out what she wants, becomes that person, and executes it perfectly. He will wear this mask for a while—he wants her to become attracted to him and be interested in more. Love Bombing and the Narcissist With Talia officially hooked, Ned moves on to his next tactic—love bombing. This works entirely by Ned showering her with the lavish praise and attention that has been discussed as being too good to be true—because it is. He is doing this for a very specific reason. People are quite motivated by very specific factors in life, and one such factor is whether they have created a positive association between whatever it is that has their attention and what they will be doing. In this case, Ned wants Talia to put together a positive association with spending time with him. He wants her to feel like he is the greatest person ever, and he will do whatever he can in order to continue to win her over. With the constant showering of praise, pushing the relationship to move quicker, and the façade of being the perfect man for her, he is able to effectively convince her to fall in love. All it took was a few gifts, plenty of kind words, and learning a bit about her. At this point, he wants to facilitate her to fall in love with her as quickly as possible, and he will continue to ride on the honeymoon period for a while. After some time, though, as the newness of the intense relationship begins to fade away, he begins to let his mask slip a bit. He stops being perfect for her all the time—after all, he believes that his true self is perfect. He may even use what is known as devaluing—he will effectively suddenly and unexpectedly knock her off of the pedestal she has become accustomed to. In knocking her off, she will effectively be left to scramble desperately to reclaim her position. She will try as hard as she can to get back to that spot, meaning she will do anything that he asks in order to regain favor. This is because the good feelings of the love bomb stage are intoxicating. They feel good and addictive, and as soon as you no longer have them, you desperately crave them once more. You will do whatever you can in order to reclaim that love and attention, as Talia has done. As soon as she does win his favor back, she feels more comfortable in her position again. However, Ned will repeat this cycle over and over again at varying lengths, all because he wants to make her feel unstable. In feeling unstable, she cannot accurately predict what will happen next. She will constantly be scrambling to remain on his good side, meaning that he has someone that is always at attention to give him whatever it is that he wants at that moment. Love bombing Victim scranblesto get back to Status quo Stable love and affection Beginning to grow indifferent Devaluing event Gaslighting and the Narcissist Beyond the cycle of convincing someone to fall in love with him, however, Ned has all sorts of other tactics up his sleeve. One such tactic is gaslighting —when you use gaslighting, you are effectively convincing the other person that they are insane. This is particularly heinous when used by the narcissist for one reason: He believes his gaslighting wholeheartedly. Most of the time, the manipulator will intentionally gaslight, knowing that it is a lie because that lie will serve a purpose that is important. It is important to go through the effort because it is seen as necessary. However, the narcissist gaslights for a slightly different reason—his narrative is simply that distorted. Unlike the manipulator, the narcissist’s perception of reality is skewed—he believes that he is the best person around. He believes that he is absolutely entitled to anything that he asks for or strives to achieve. He believes that he does deserve to be recognized as superior. However, as the normal person looking in knows, these are nothing but delusions. These delusions are incredibly powerful, however, and the narcissist believes them wholeheartedly. When he uses gaslighting, then reciting his narrative of what he believes has happened, he believes what he is saying. He believes that he is the victim because that distorted belief is better than the alternative, which would have been to acknowledge that he is not as perfect as he attempts to be. If he were to admit that, he would let go of everything integral to who he is, so instead, he convinces himself that his narrative is the right narrative. Of course, that then means that the narrative that everyone else gets is just as skewed. However, the narcissist’s narrative is harder to discern from the truth. With manipulators, you can usually pick up on signs of deception, but with the narcissist, they believe what they are saying. That makes this dangerous— they may entirely believe that the person that got the promotion did so in order to get back at the narcissist. They may believe that the person that broke up with them did it so they could sleep around and hurt the narcissist —so long as the narcissist is the victim within the gaslighting, the narcissist will continue to sing that narrative. Projection and the Narcissist As a sort of contrast to the act of mirroring, narcissists are also adept at projection as well. They will take their own traits and assign them to other people in accordance to whether they want to scapegoat out the other person or make them favored. In particular, you see this sort of behavioral tactic play out with narcissistic parents toward their children—the favored child will be referred to as the golden child for this section, and is the child that can do no wrong. The narcissist usually identifies very closely with the golden child and will allow the golden child to do anything. They see the golden child as the extension of all things good about themselves. The scapegoated child, however, is given all of the negatives. If the narcissist believes that he is, for example, someone with low self esteem, which some narcissists are, the scapegoat will be treated as a sort of effigy for all of that negativity. The narcissist will funnel all negativity about himself onto the scapegoat and take it out on him or her. If the scapegoat wants to have friends over, he is punished. If he wants new clothes, he is given hand me downs while his younger brother gets to go out and shop at the name brand stores. The scapegoat is effectively victimized and taught to take the abuse. If anything goes wrong, it is always the scapegoat’s fault, with no exceptions. This, of course, is an incredibly damaging dynamic. The golden child never learns consequences and usually winds up being quite narcissistic himself, while the scapegoat instead gets attacked with all of the negativity and taught to be quite codependent instead, as her needs are never met, and she is taught that she must always please the narcissist and the golden child. The scapegoat will be begging for any scraps of affection and kindness, which are only occasionally shown when the scapegoat has put the narcissist’s needs first. DARVO and the Narcissist The final tactic that we will discuss with the narcissist is his skilled ability to reverse nearly any argument or problem. Even if he is the attacker, he will find a way to spin things around if you are not familiar with his method known as DARVO. +f; ery: Standing for Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim, and Offender, DARVO is an incredibly powerful technique. If you do not know what you are looking for, it is next to impossible to accurately notice and evade. You need to be able to recognize that the narcissist is intentionally trying to derail the argument instead of actually making a good point. For example, let’s go back to Ned and Talia. Talia is crying because she feels like she was taken advantage of. She tells Ned that she is furious and that she wishes he had never bothered coming around because she would much rather have been able to grieve the loss of her fiancé without his negative presence. Ned, then, points out that she has always held her fiancé over his head and that she has always made him so incredibly pressured to try to live up to this dead man’s idealized image. He points out how difficult it is to win out over a man that is dead, gone, and will only ever be remembered fondly, and in response, he points out how she is even doing it right now. Let’s pause for a moment and consider what just happened—did Talia ever actually say anything about Ned not being good enough? No—she said that she wished that she had never put up with such a negative presence. She never compared the two and instead only made it a point to mention that she would have rather been able to avoid Ned and all of the narcissistic toxicity that he brought with him. However, Ned was able to spin it around, and suddenly, he was the poor victim that needed sympathy. He was the one who was made to feel not good enough, in his narrative. He was the one held to an impossible standard. Notice how he effectively flipped the narrative, all by denying what Talia had first said, then attacking her to put her on the defensive. With Talia on the defensive, she is going to be so busy attempting to protect herself that he is able to get away with the argument. He has completely distracted her from her initial anger and instead put her on guard, meaning he now has the complete advantage. This is the power of DARVO— it is an important tactic to remember because if you can identify it when it happens, you can effectively stop it from occurring. All you need to do is refuse to give in to the attempt to attack and reverse—for example, instead of taking the bait, Talia may mention that Ned’s description of things never happened and that his own feelings on what she was discussing are entirely irrelevant at that point in time as she was addressing something unrelated to her fiancé. She simply wanted to be given the freedom to grieve without interruption, and she felt like Ned had stolen that chance from her. Chapter 7: The Effects of Narcissistic Abuse Now, you have seen a bit about what the narcissist can do if they are given the in. You have seen how they are able to manipulate with ease, and how they have several tactics that can make them particularly dangerous when interacting with other people. However, so far, other than looking at a few of the signs of abuse within relationships, what has not been addressed and truly discussed is the impact that the abuse of the narcissist can really cause. Narcissistic abuse is different from traditional emotional abuse—that much has become glaringly obvious. However, the abuse that the narcissist uses seems to leave far deeper emotional scars. Perhaps related to the fact that the narcissist is able to betray the most sensitive, intimate parts of you— your heart. More often than not, the narcissist is able to convince you to believe in the existence of someone who never existed, convincing you to fall in love with someone who was little more than a figment of the narcissist’s imagination. Talia was so angry, not because of Ned himself, or because Ned was not good enough, but rather because Ned had lied. Ned had made her fall for someone that she thought would bring her happiness, and he did, for a short while. Of course, that happiness very quickly was destroyed altogether, leaving Talia reeling as she tried to cope with the sudden realization. Ultimately, some of the effects of narcissistic abuse can be worse in some ways than the abuse of emotional abusers, particularly because of the betrayal and demand for utter obedience from the narcissist. Within this chapter, we will go over five of the potential side effects of narcissistic abuse that many people in recovery must go through. We will take a look at echoism, the impact of narcissism on self confidence, the development of a codependent personality, common mental health issues that arise, and finally, post traumatic stress disorder, a very serious, very debilitating form of anxiety. As you read through this chapter after having come from an abusive relationship, do not be afraid, and do not let your feelings get the best of you—remember, you are going to be learning how to overcome these side effects. You are well on your way to healing if you have taken the effort to read this far into this book, and you will be able to succeed in healing. However, you must be aware of your injuries before you can treat them. As painful as it can be to stop and look at all of the ways that the narcissist in your life has hurt you, whether through damaging your self confidence, causing anxiety, or leading to echoism, you can heal. You can reclaim your life. Repeat that to yourself—you can and WILL reclaim your life, one step and one day at a time. Echoism The first significant impact that we will look at is echoism. If you are familiar with the myth of Narcissus, you know that a young nymph named Echo had fallen in love with Narcissus. He rejected her, and she faded away. Appalled at the rejection, Narcissus was punished, cursed to stare into a puddle of water at his reflection until he, too, died. All that remained of Echo after the rejection was her voice, a mere shadow of who she once was before Narcissus refused her. When we are talking about echoism with humans, then we are looking at how people tend to respond to narcissists and the abuse of narcissists. In particular, echoism is a trait—this trait, in particular, measuring as a fear of becoming a narcissist. The echoists, then, are afraid of their own needs. They are kind, but terrified by the possibility of burdening those around them. They wish to support others without acknowledgment and praise, preferring instead to remain in the background and blending in. They usually struggle with praise and attention, feeling like they cannot voice what they want, even if they know whatever that is. The echoist, then, is like the anti narcissist. While the narcissist needs attention, the echoist fears it. While the narcissist thrives on control and determining what will happen, the echoist would rather be told what to do. When the narcissist becomes abusive, the echoists blame themselves for the problem. Ultimately, then, the echoist is able to help other people meet their own needs, but struggles to ever acknowledge and meet their own. They are constantly hiding in the backdrop. While of course, some people have this personality type naturally, even without ever suffering at the hand of an abuser or narcissist, others develop it seemingly from their abuse. They grew aversive to needing their needs met, learning that any attention is uncomfortable because it means that the narcissist will be turning his greedy, jealous eyes on them soon after. It becomes easier when your life is overshadowed by a narcissist, to simply let it all pass you by while you hide in the background. Praise then gets dismissed as luck or saying that it was just really easy. However, anything negative is automatically the fault of the echoist. Typically, after so long of being made inferior and taught to help the narcissist rather than take care of themselves, the echoists become willing to just do exactly that. Similar to the codependent, they feel like their only purpose in life is to make sure that everyone else is cared for, and in doing so, they struggle. As needs pile up, completely unmet, they grow unhealthier. They find themselves miserable, and they often feel stuck. If you are afraid that you may be an echoist, do not fret—just as with all of the other negative aspects of discovering that you have been a victim of a narcissist, you can heal this one as well. Losing Self Confidence Another common side effect of a relationship with a narcissist is the loss of self confidence. Even the most confident person in the world will eventually be worn down around the narcissist without the proper protection, so if you happened to find that the narcissist destroyed what was once a confident individual, you are not alone. The narcissist’s tactics usually sneak by completely unnoticed unless you take the time to learn them, and if not, you may find your own self confidence waning. Self confidence is critical for people—it is how you learn to trust yourself to take care of yourself. When you are self confident, you trust that you are capable of doing the right thing, and you inherently trust your own decisions and judgments. You are certain that you will always be behaving in ways that are beneficial to you and you trust that you will be successful. Self confidence is not the same as grandiosity in the sense that the narcissist is grandiose—self confidence is usually healthy. It is good to be self confident, so long as your self confidence is accurate and warranted, taking time to acknowledge that you do, like everyone else around you, have certain weaknesses that must be accommodated for. Because the narcissist is so quick to tell people that they are less than the narcissist in any way possible, always downplaying any achievements, it is only natural that over time, that self confidence would wane. After hearing the narcissist tell you that you are stupid enough times, you will naturally internalize it, simply because people tend to be more susceptible to beliefs that they hear on repeat over and over again. The narcissist’s abuse eventually does this to your self confidence overall, leaving you a shell of your former glory. Becoming Codependent Codependency has already been touched upon within this book so far, and it will be addressed once more in a bit more depth here, as it is an important consequence of narcissistic abuse in several situations. When you are exposed to a narcissist, you are commonly given two choices: Give in or be abused. The narcissist will attempt to browbeat almost anyone into submission, and in the event that submission is impossible, the narcissist then rejects the other person under the guise of having wanted to do that all along. When you are browbeaten into submission threatened with being forced into submission, you very quickly learn to fear the narcissist. Especially if you were a child that grew up under a narcissistic parent, you may find that any time you had needs, they were always overshadowed and rejected altogether. You were not allowed to have needs without punishment, or having those needs barely met at all. Codependency eventually develops then when someone has been forced to give up their own needs in favor of other people’s over and over again on repeat until they no longer tried to meet those needs anymore. For example, imagine that you grew up with a narcissistic father and a codependent mother. You were likely constantly taught from a young age to put your father’s needs first. Your mother would feed your father first—specifically what he wanted. If you were crying because you had gotten hurt, but your father was going off on some tirade about something, your mother would attend to him. It was even so bad that the time that you fell and broke your arm, your mom stopped and fetched your father his dinner and beer before helping you, despite the fact that you were crying in pain. This sort of constant neglect eventually taught you that trying to meet your needs was pointless—they would never have been met anyway. You would not be able to get them met no matter how hard you tried, and the message that you internalized early on was not to have needs. They did not get met, so why bother wasting time thinking about them? You may have learned to forget about your hunger or thirst, until you would stand up and get dizzy, realizing that you had not eaten or had any water in a while. You would frequently forget to make sure that you dressed appropriately or that you were prepared for events and outings simply because you never had to bother with your own needs. Growing up or being forced into the shadow of a narcissist will cause people to become incredibly codependent. They will find that their self esteem drops, something closely related to the drop in self confidence. They will become people pleasing, feeling like they must take care of everyone else without complaint. They will struggle to create any sort of boundaries at all in relationships, believing that they are unimportant or should not be enforced. They identify closely with the caretaker, meaning that they must constantly be engaging with other people and taking care of them to find any real value in their lives. They must maintain some sort of control, whether on their own behaviors or feeling like they are in control of the narcissist, usually in the form of taking the blame for everything that happens. They are dependent upon the relationships that they are in, terrified of being rejected, and they will obsess over their relationships and the anxiety surrounding being rejected. Ultimately, the codependent becomes someone hardly capable of functioning in a healthy capacity in real relationships. Because the codependent is so set upon making sure that all needs are met without fail and making sure that they take the blame for any behavioral issues within the relationship, there is always an unhealthy dynamic in a codependent’s relationships, and for that reason alone, codependency must be defeated. Mental Health Issues Ultimately, narcissistic abuse causes mental health issues, as well. Aside from echoism and codependency, you can see very real, diagnosable disorders as well. The victims of abuse may go on to suffer from depression, and with that depression, they often feel like they will never be able to get out. The narcissistic relationship can be a constant drain on any healthy thoughts or hope within the individual, eventually resulting entirely in depression. The depression can be long lasting and pervasive as the victim finds themselves isolated, alone, and abused on a regular basis. Rather than being able to escape, they are stuck, alone, and with nothing but abuse to show for it. Anxiety is another common mental health issue that arises. The victim may find themselves feeling anxious at just the thought of the narcissist, or the displeasure that they are certain will be problematic in the future. They know that the narcissist is abusive and they fear that abuse. However, they also find themselves powerless to stop it. Instead, they find themselves constantly living in a state of heightened stress. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a very specific side effect to the abuse that the narcissist tries to dish out. Those suffering from PTSD often struggle in life—even little things that are vaguely reminiscent of the narcissist can be enough to trigger the victim to find themselves in the midst of a panic attack, and that is something that no person wants to have to endure. Post traumatic stress disorder arises from the mind trying to cope with trauma. The exact cause is not yet known, though psychologists are leaning toward it being related to the brain’s ability to process memories. If the brain of the individual with PTSD is unable to properly process the memories, it is quite likely that the individual will then suffer further from the negative side effects. They will have recurring nightmares about the abuse or about the narcissist, or they will find that they are largely unable to protect themselves from any flashbacks that may arise in response to triggering stimuli. If you find that you are suffering from PTSD, you are going to want to speak to a doctor or other licensed medical professional. There is only so much advice that can be given through a book without being able to directly speak to the individual suffering from symptoms, so the best thing that you can do is to get a diagnosis from a proper medical professional and begin treatment with therapy and possibly medication. While you can attempt to treat the symptoms of PTSD at home, the management without guidance is not always effective. It can help, but if you want to truly find relief, you are going to want to make sure that you have that guidance and personalized advice that you can only get in a one on one interaction. Chapter 8: Disarming the Narcissist Narcissists are notoriously difficult to get rid of, even if you try. More often than not, if you want to get the narcissist to go away, you need to figure out how to do it in a way that makes them think that going away was their idea altogether. You want them to believe that they were in control, so they do not take your attempt to avoid them as a way of subverting their perceived control over the situation. Remember, the narcissist is convinced wholeheartedly that he or she is entirely responsible for everything. They believe that they control everyone around them, struggling to see anyone else as a legitimate human being deserving of respect or care. When you find yourself stuck interacting with a narcissist and trying to get rid of them, or at the very least, removing their ability to hurt you, there are several tactics that you can use that have not yet been discussed within the scope of this book. You can make it a point to cut off the narcissist and disappear completely, potentially moving somewhere that the narcissist will never be able to find you, but that is not always practical or possible. For that reason, this chapter will guide you through five ways to remove power from the narcissist. Of course, the most effective way to disarm the narcissist is to avoid contact completely, and this will be the first topic discussed. Depending on the relationships with the narcissist, you may be in a position in which you can cut them off altogether, and allow yourself the space you need. Beyond that, there are techniques such as being able to set up a boundary that is enforced, or becoming what is commonly called the “grey rock” in order to make the narcissist think that you are boring. What is consistent no matter what the method you choose, however, is to make sure that you are firm in whatever you choose. If you cut off, you must stay cut off. If you are willing to take advantage of boundaries, you must always enforce them and the consequences of not respecting those boundaries. If you are to relent on your attempts to manage the narcissist, even just slightly, you will encourage the narcissist—the narcissist will be aware of the discovered weakness, and that means that the narcissist will be able to take advantage in the future, as well as encourage future attempts as well. As you read through these methods, keep in mind that you will want to make sure that whatever you choose works for you. Narcissists are not a one size fits all situation, and you will have to figure out exactly how will work best for the narcissist in your life. Some are relatively trainable—with some reinforcement and constant use of boundaries, you may be able to maintain some sort of a distant relationship with them. In other instances, you may be best served by cutting your losses and moving on. Cut Off Contact Completely The first tactic is by far the most effective, but it is not always practical. If you are able to cut off the narcissist, please do so. You will find that, after the initial extinction burst, life becomes far more peaceful. You will be so much happier without the narcissist controlling your life and making it impossible for you to find enjoyment in anything. If you will be cutting off the narcissist completely, you can do so by stating your boundary, such as saying that you are no longer interested in a relationship and asking that the narcissist does not contact you again. From there, you simply ignore any attempts to contact you. If they show up to your house, you can call the police and have them told to leave or risk trespassing charges. If you find that they are particularly persistent, you can always try moving, changing your number, and moving on, especially if they live rather close to you. If they are long distance, just blocking numbers may be enough, though they may try to show up again at some point in the future. When you are cutting off a narcissist, you are likely to be met with resistance—after all, the narcissist will not be ignored on anyone else’s terms, or at least that is what he thinks. You may receive phone calls from family members, asking how you could be so cruel as to cut off poor Grandpa Frank, never mind the fact that he has been abusive for the last several years. What matters here more than anything, however, is that you must remain firm. If you ever give in to the demand for contact, you have rewarded the narcissist. You have taught the narcissist that if they push you exactly that much, they can get you to relent, and they will use that tactic again in the future. Just as a toddler throwing a temper tantrum should never be rewarded, you want to keep your distance from the narcissist as well. Keep in mind that if you cut off, you are going to expect what is known as an extinction burst—this is essentially how the narcissist will behave in response to the fact that you have suddenly stopped rewarding his attempts to control you, as you always have. You are suddenly working in a way that is not normal, and that does not compute to his mind. Think of how if you were to go outside, only to find that your car did not start, you would try again and again, growing increasingly more frantic for a few minutes as you desperately tried to crank the car. After a few minutes, you would probably give up and call the mechanic. However, the narcissist will not—he will repeatedly crank and crank and crank until something gives. Remember, the narcissist is rarely able to see the world rationally and is more likely to be guided by his own skewed and distorted worldview than anything else. In this case, however, your obedience and attention would be what he was seeking instead of a car starting, and he will try over and over again. In particular, you will see the demands ramp up exponentially over a short period of time, and it is imperative that you do not ever give in—if you give in during this time, it will be far more difficult in the future. Let the extinction burst die out. It will be rough for a short while, but after you make it clear that you will not respond, there is a good chance that the narcissist will simply declare that they did not like you and that they cut you off, and he will be on his way. Become the Grey Rock Another technique that is a bit more realistic if you cannot cut off for some reason, such as if you share children with a narcissistic ex, is to become the grey rock. Think about the last time you took a walk outside. Maybe you went through your yard, or maybe you went hiking. Can you remember any of the rocks you saw? Chances are, you cannot. And this is normal. The rocks are so mundane and irrelevant to your daily life that you have no reason to focus on them in the first place. Looking at the rocks does not matter to you because they are boring, and you do not commit any of them to memory. You want to channel that with the narcissist. If you can channel the boringness and mundaneness of that rock, you can bore the narcissist out of bothering with you in the future. All you need to do is ensure that you are as plain as possible in any and all interactions with them. Let’s say that you have children with your ex, and this is why you cannot simply cut them off. If he asks you how you are doing, you would simply ignore the question. If he asks you about the children, you answer shortly and with as little detail as possible. If he has any demands for you, instead of arguing about how they are ridiculous, you can say, “Okay.” And leave it at that if you are going to give in, or ignore them if they are not acceptable. Just as with the cut off method, you will find that the narcissist will ramp up in an attempt to get you to reply, but keep on ignoring it. You do not need to acknowledge anything irrelevant to children or other shared endeavors. This means that anything that does not require a response will not get one, and over time, the narcissist will get bored with being ignored. There is little to gain out of being entirely ignored, and the narcissist knows that. In the end, the narcissist will likely lose interest and leave you alone, just as with the cut off method. Take Advantage of Time Another common method that you can use, preferably in conjunction with the grey rock method, is to learn how to use time to your advantage. The narcissist is likely used to you jumping any time he asks you to. This means that he absolutely expects that behavior to continue. He will assume that you will jump any time he send that message to you. If he asks you for help, he assumes that you will drop everything and come to his aid. What you can do to eliminate that particular assumption is make sure that you actively end it. Set the narcissist to silent on your phone if you can so his messages do not bother you as they all come flying in, and do not respond. You should set some arbitrary amount of time to get back to him, if at all, simply because there is no reason for you to respond at his beck and call. If you are busy, then you are busy, and your phone is for your own convenience, not for the convenience of those around you. Start by pushing out your responses for a few hours for a while. Maybe decide that you will wait to read the narcissist’s messages for an hour after they arrive, and then enforce another hour during which you are debating how best to approach your response. This means that there would be a bare minimum of two hours between noticing the message and responding if you felt it warranted a response. This will be difficult at first, especially if you have been trained to respond to the narcissist any time he asks you to do something. You will find it hard to overcome that programming that makes you feel like you have no choice but to immediately reply. However, that is exactly what the narcissist wants, and you need to figure out how best to overcome it once and for all. Overcoming it is possible if you put in the effort, and while it will be uncomfortable, it will be well worth it. Over time, you will destroy that expectation that the narcissist has that you will be readily available at any moment if the narcissist determines that you should be. You will find that the narcissist will message you less and less, and that is absolutely okay with you. Create and Enforce Boundaries When you are in a healthy relationship, boundaries are expected. If you are going to be enforcing boundaries, you want to ensure that you are setting ones that are meaningful for you. Your boundaries are basically the laws for respect for yourself—they are the line you draw that marks behaviors that you will not tolerate. For example, a very common boundary that goes unspoken in most relationships is that there will be no physical violence. This means that both parties are well aware of the fact that everyone expects a complete lack of physical violence within the relationship, and both parties are willing to recognize and follow that boundary Narcissists are not fond of boundaries for good reason—they stand in the narcissist’s way. When the narcissist wants to control someone, they cannot exactly manage that if someone has a boundary specifically about wanting to be free to make decisions on his own. The narcissist then sees that boundary as a sort of challenge—the narcissist wants to take it down and prove that it does not matter. After all, the narcissist is special, remember? He believes that he is deserving of the honor of being able to stomp all over it without consequence simply because of his uniqueness and superiority. Of course, that is not the case. You absolutely can and should set boundaries, no matter what the narcissist says, and if anyone tries to completely steamroll those boundaries, then you know that they are not safe or respectful people to have in your life. If they are going to willingly throw away your boundaries without regard for how you feel, you cannot trust them at all, and that is a problem. You should be able to trust the people in your life. When you do set a boundary, you should make sure that you state that boundary explicitly to the narcissist, as well as pair it with a consequence. For example, you could tell the narcissist, “If you are going to continue to belittle me, I will end this visit until you are willing to talk to me like a respectful adult. The next time that he belittles you, and he will belittle you again to test that boundary, you must end the visit. You can simply stand up, pack your belongings, acknowledge that you are not okay with that behavior, and leave, telling him that you can try again when he is ready to be respectful. Most likely, he will whine and throw a fit about how you are so cruel for punishing him for his misbehavior, but think about it this way—you are not punishing him, you are protecting yourself. You are setting a reasonable boundary—to not be called names or belittled, and it is not punishment for the name caller for you to put distance between them and yourself. Would you call it punishing the snake if you refused to touch it because you knew that it would bit you? No—it is protecting yourself. You can try the interaction again after whatever period of time that you said would happen between the next disregard of boundaries, reiterating the boundary that you have for yourself and the consequence to ignoring it. The trick here is that you must follow through every time you put out a consequence. You need to be able to tell the narcissist that you will honor your own boundaries to protect yourself, whether he likes it or not, and do so to protect yourself. His comfort is not your responsibility, and if he really wanted to continue with the visit, he would not have caused you so many problems or ignored your very reasonable boundaries. Create Some Distance Sometimes, the best approach to a relationship with a narcissist is to create a slow fade away from how often you contact them. Effectively, you will slowly take more and more time to contact them in between normal intervals, stretching out the time between the frequency of contact when you begin and where you would like to be. For example, imagine that you have a narcissistic father. You love your father, but he is incredibly exhausting to deal with. Presently, he tries to call you every day at least twice, and you are finding that it is putting a huge strain on your own daily life. After all, you have your own life and children, and while you can understand a father wanting to communicate with his grown child, you also know that you are too busy for two hour long conversations out of your day, amounting to a whopping 13% of your waking hours. That is time that you could spend with your children, tending to yourself, keeping up with housework, or just sitting and enjoying the silence. After all, between work, school for the children, housework, homework, and making sure that everyone is ready for the next day, you feel like you only ever have a few minutes of peace to yourself. In this instance, you could make it a point to create some distance slowly with your narcissistic father. You would slowly stretch out how often you reply or get back to him. Perhaps you start by ignoring that first phone call every couple days—that is already significant and gets you a few hours of your time back per week. From there, you may decide to let your father know that you are busy when he calls and that you will give him a call over the weekend when things are less stressful. Over time, you would go from two phone calls a day, to a phone call every few days, to eventually once every week or two. This process takes time and patience, but eventually, you are able to stretch out the visits. Expect some pushback, as with all other narcissistic strategies, as the narcissist hates change that is not on his own terms. The fact that you are changing his schedule and expectations is a huge slight to him, and he will not be happy about it or respecting it, despite the fact that it is in your best interest. Chapter 9: Leaving the Abusive Relationship At this point, you may realize that your relationship is ruined. It is damaged beyond repair, and you know that you need out. However, leaving is always easier said than done, and especially if you cohabit and share children, all sorts of legalities must also be considered in order to safely exit without trouble. After all of the insight that you have gained through reading this book so far, you may now recognize that the abuse in your relationship is not going anywhere—it is there to stay. That is terrifying for most people and not something that you necessarily want to put up with. However, that is exactly why this guide exists. You can leave. This chapter will tell you how to leave, detailing what you should prepare. You can free yourself from the abuser’s grasp once and for all, breaking those chains and freeing yourself from the life of torment and abuse that you otherwise would have to endure. When you are sure that you are ready to leave, remember three things: Your partner will not change. You cannot help your partner to change. Your partner will promise and beg to keep you, but this is because he does not want to lose control. Ultimately, he is not ever going to put in the long term effort to change, especially if he is a narcissist because the narcissistic personality disorder that he suffers from prevents him from ever acknowledging that he is the problem in the first place. This means that he is going to remain the abusive person that he is, no matter how much you may want him to change. That is not your fault, and it is okay to grieve for that relationship that you have lost. However, do not let that grief hold you back from breaking those chains and finding freedom and health. Get Your Ducks in a Row As cute as this imagery may be, getting your ducks in a row is your ability to get everything in line and ready to go. You are going to be actively trying to make sure that everything that you will need in your exit is in one place and prepared. This stage will involve anything legal that you may need to do. Do you share children? Start looking into custody and what you will need to do to file for emergency custody. It is possible that if you have documentation to prove abuse, that you can get emergency custody of your children. In some states, if you are unwed as a mother, you retain full custody, even if your child’s father is on the birth certificate. Make sure that you consult a lawyer to double check on the legality of these things and ensure that you do not make any missteps that will damage your fight for custody. You will also want to make sure that all important documentation is lined up. Do you know where your legal paperwork is? Do you have your social security card and birth certificate? How about all paperwork for the car, insurance, joint property, and anything else relevant to you? Make sure that you gather up all important legal documents as well as making sure that you gather anything for your children as well. You want to make sure that you have the paperwork declaring custody if it is already worked out. If you are going to be filing for a restraining order and emergency custody, get all of that as well. With the paperwork lined up, you need to make sure that you also have all of your sentimental, irreplaceable items in one place that is easy to grab. Make sure that you have computers, hard drives, photo albums, and anything else that you would be devastated to lose if the narcissist decides to get destructive to punish you for leaving. You will want to put this all ina bag that you can carry out quickly, placing it with all of the legal paperwork. These are your go bags—they are there for you to take and leave as quickly as possible if the need should arise. Make sure that the go bag also has chargers—you want to have a spare set of car keys, some money, your phone and computer charger, anything that you will need for children if you do not have time to stop and gather things otherwise, and anything else that you know that you would need for a trip that is a few nights long. Remember, ultimately, your physical belongings can be replaced, and while you should put in the effort to protect your belongings if you can, if you cannot, do not bother. Focus on making sure you and your children and pets are out if you can. Ducksin a Row Checklist * All legal paperwork * Birth certificate/SSNs * Mortgages/leases * Car ownership papers * Bank information * Marriage paperwork * Insurance information * Diplomas/proof of education * Any important or sentimental items * Cell phone charger . Keys * Money Create a Safety Plan Leaving the relationship is perhaps the most dangerous time in an abusive relationship, and because of that, you need to have a safety plan in place. Think of this as a contingency plan just in case anything goes wrong—you never want to use it, but you want it to be there just in case. This safety plan should involve you identifying several safe areas in your home, as well as the best paths to get there. You will want to make sure that, if you notice that your abuser is starting to escalate, you can make sure that you are not trapped .This means that you should avoid areas with small spaces or that can have you blocked in regularly. You will also want to make sure that you avoid a room such as a kitchen, which is full of all sorts of easily weaponized items. Include your children in the safety plan as well—as much as you may be hoping that they are protected from the abuse, they most likely know that it is happening. Have a code word that you use to tell your children to get to your side or get to a safe spot immediately and without argument. In particular, you will want to make sure that you practice this several times, such as turning it into a game. Maybe your code word is “Sticky Tape!” and as soon as your children hear it, they all must run to touch you as soon as possible and stick to you like tape. This is a good way to remove some of the fear while still having it readily remembered for your children. Create an Escape Plan Now, with your ducks in a row, your belongings ready, and your children and yourself prepared with a safety plan, it is time to put together your escape plan. The safest may be to attempt to leave when your abuser is not present at home, such as during the workday, if at all possible. If not, you can try in the middle of the night. If your partner is home, you are always welcome to call for a police escort to get yourself and your children out of the home safely and without incident. Make sure that your escape plan involves where you will go, how you will get there, and how you will protect yourself. Can you go to stay with family that will help keep you safe while you stabilize? If not, consider a domestic violence shelter, as those ware well protected and can keep you and your children safe during this dangerous time. When it is time, make sure that you do not hesitate—go as soon as you said that you would to protect yourself and your children and remember that you are doing the right thing. This is not an easy process—leaving is never easy, especially if you do not have any money on you or access to the money. However, be proud that you are not willing to let yourself be held down, unable to live your life in peace and safety. You are choosing to move forward toward safety and happiness, and that is quite noble on its own. When you are ready to escape, keep in mind that your technology can be your worst enemy here—if you are trying to leave, you need to ensure that your abuser cannot possibly track you. If you have a smartphone, consider leaving it behind and buying a new burner phone if you can get away with it. Make sure that you log out of all iterations of family tracking and GPS monitoring that may exist on your phones, tablets, and computers. Beyond that, you will want to ensure that you change your passwords on all accounts as well, so your abuser cannot log in and track you or who you are talking to. The Aftermath Right after you have left, it is critical that you make sure that your information is kept as private as possible. You will want to make sure that you use a burner phone or a new phone number, which you specifically want to remain unlisted. You do not want anyone being able to track your number to your name. While most of the time, when you are moving, you make it a point to fill out a forwarding address with the post office to ensure that you get all of your mail, consider having it all forwarded to a PO box instead. This will mean that the only notification that your ex may be able to get is that you are using a PO box in a certain area. As you are setting up your new life, you will want to make sure that you disconnect from any and all bank or credit accounts that are shared—make sure that you speak to a lawyer about ownership beforehand if possible, as that can change from state to state, depending upon marital status and several other factors as well. You will absolutely want to avoid using any cards that your ex has access to, as your ex will be able to see where you are making transactions, and that can be enough information to piece together a general idea of where you are, something that you likely want to avoid. If you do happen to remain in the same city or town due to jobs, school, or other obligations, change up your routine. If you have children in school and daycare, you may want to consider reenrolling them elsewhere, as your ex, assuming he is their father, would likely be able to pick them up without any protest if they wanted to. Changing up as much of your routine will help you avoid being easily tracked. Keep in mind that your charged cell phone should be on your person at all times, and you should never hesitate to call for help if you need it. Once again, remember that you are doing the right thing in freeing yourself from the relationship. Following these steps can be helpful, but if you are unable to get access to the proper funds or necessities, or you do not have a mode of transportation to get out of the home, you can call your local domestic violence hotline. They should have resources that can help you remove yourself and your children from the home. As a benefit, domestic violence hotlines and shelters will have access to several benefits that can really help you get out of the abusive relationship and free yourself once and for all. You will have access to lawyers, shelters, financial help, counselors, and more, all of whom will specialize in helping and working with people in situations like yours. Chapter 10: Staying Free Once you are finally out of the relationship, you may find that after some time, you miss it. You will miss your ex, and while he may have been abusive or threatening, you still spent a portion of your life with him and feel like you want that back. It is only natural to miss those that you care about, but ultimately, you must have the self confidence and self discipline to remind yourself that you made the right decision to leave. In particular, you may find that you miss the good times, and that is natural. If your relationship had been nothing but negative, it never would have progressed beyond the initial date—the narcissist had to be able to win you over somehow, and that usually involves some sort of façade and persona. Nevertheless, it can be incredibly difficult to avoid the feelings of wanting to go back to the abuser, even after you have finally escaped once and for all. Keep in mind that if you have just escaped your relationship and feel like you want to go back, you are not alone. On average, it takes at least seven attempts for a person to break free from an abusive partner. However, just because wanting to go back and knowing that other people regularly go back does not mean that you should simply decide to go back because you miss your ex—you should try to resist. Retain that freedom that you fought for so hard and make sure that you stay free. In particular, this chapter will take the time to provide you with some advice designed to help keep you from returning to your abusive situation despite the temptation and desire you may have to do exactly that. Even if you are depressed where you are, or feeling like your home would be better than the room in a shelter that you are in, resist. Any time that you feel like you are wishing that things were different or when you tell yourself that you are struggling due to your own failures, remind yourself that abuse is not your fault. It is not your fault that you were targeted by a narcissist. You were preyed upon by the abuser, and that had nothing to do with who you are or what you deserve. You could never have known that everything would play out the way that they did. That is not your fault, and it never will be. The road to recovery begins with you no longer taking blame for the narcissist’s actions. This means that you must reject the idea that you are somehow at fault for everything that happened. The abuse lies firmly with the narcissist, and you need to remind yourself of that. Remind yourself that no one deserves to be abused in your moments of weakness, and remind yourself that you may not be where you had hoped to be, but at least you are free. You have left that cage once and for all and you are finally free to stretch your wings and learn to fly. Now that you are away, it is time to stay away. You can do it. Find Support The first way that can help you strengthen your resolve during those moments of weakness is to find support. Find friends or family that you can turn to if you need to talk during those moments, knowing that you will be fully and wholly supported by them when you do so. Make sure that you primarily surround yourself with people that you know and trust, or find a support group for people with similar stories to you. If you have gone through a domestic violence shelter, you may already have access to this by having access to all of the resources that usually follow the shelter. They likely have support groups held for those living at the shelter at any given time. If they do not have a support group, they can surely point you in the right direction toward finding one that will be beneficial to you. You are very likely to find that being able to talk to other people will actually be incredibly beneficial to you—when you can talk to others, you are free to hear other stories .Just knowing that other people have lived through what you have been through can help you find comfort in those moments of loneliness when you are wondering where you went so wrong. You will be able to branch out and make new friends who have been where you are. They will know how to help you simply because they will have been there before, and their advice can be absolutely critical to keeping you afloat during such a dark time. Write Down Your Reasons for Leaving Another way that may help you fight off all of the tempting feelings of going back to the narcissist is to write down every reason that you left. Spend the time when you are safe to go over what made you finally pull the trigger and leave. For Talia, it was that the Ned she knew was a lie. She did not appreciate being fooled into falling in love for someone who never existed in the first place. For you, it could be that you are sick of the abuse. You finally acknowledge that you deserve better, or that your children deserve better. If you do have children, look at them. Do they deserve to grow up in a home full of dysfunction? Do you really want that life for them? Most parents would never want that for their children, and for them, leaving would be the obvious choice. Of course, just because you know that you would want better for your children does not mean that your feelings will just stop. Your feelings are just that—feelings—, and they are not to be believed. After having written down all of the reasons that you can think of for leaving, you can return to the list any time that you are feeling week. Are you thinking about that one date that you had that was entirely romantic, next to the beach? Remind yourself that it was probably a lie and that the narcissist most likely felt nothing for you and read over your list. Are you realizing that your birthday is coming up, and you are going to have to spend it without an adult to talk to? Read over that list again and remind yourself why it is so important to you. Consider also writing down any and all instances of suspected gaslighting that you can think of. Think about all the times that your ex told you something was wrong or that you were not remembering things properly. Think of how you felt, feeling like you were slowly losing your mind, and latch onto that anger. Tell yourself that you are not going to accept that treatment again, and you are not willing to return to being treated like you cannot possibly understand what is right in front of your face. Find a Hobby Perhaps one of the least specific pieces of advice that you are ever going to receive consider finding a hobby or something else to keep you busy during moments of weakness. Just having something else to do to occupy the time can help the feeling pass, even when you are feeling tempted to return back to the narcissist for any reason at all. Have you ever wanted to try something new or learn a new skill? This is the time to go for it—figure out exactly what it is that you have been wanting in life and go for it. If you have always dreamed of learning to draw without being mocked or laughed at for whatever you have chosen as your medium or subject, now is your time. Do you want to make it a point to learn how to knit? Take some extra cash if you have it and go get a beginner’s kit. You have nothing but time on your hands that used to be filled by the narcissist —take it back and do something for yourself. This does two things: Not only are you keeping yourself busy, but you are also doing something to better yourself, and bettering yourself may help you feel better about yourself. Boosting your self confidence as you succeed at a new skill is always a huge welcome bonus. Chapter 11: The Importance of Empathy Empathy is one of those buzzwords that you hear thrown around a lot in modern psychology and self help sources. You may hear the empath discussed, especially in regards to narcissism. You may hear people say that they are an empath at heart, or that they are incredibly empathetic. However, do you know what is meant by calling someone an empath? Empaths are people who are highly in tune to their surroundings and those within them. In particular, they are usually able to sense the feelings of others with ease. This is a skill known as empathy, and this is a critical skill for people to master. Empathy is the skill that the narcissist does not have— he cannot empathize, and because he cannot empathize, he cannot effectively manage to relate to other people. How about you? Are you empathetic? Do you have a good idea of what empathy is? Do you want to be more empathetic? What can empathetic behavior help you do, and how can it be beneficial? All of these are fantastic questions to ask if you are unfamiliar with the concept of empathy itself. Even if you are unfamiliar, do not fret—this chapter is focused on empathy and how you can use it to protect yourself. In particular, we will delve into looking at what empathy is, what the types of empathy are, and how empathy can be used to help you better yourself. You will see how empathy can fight narcissism, as well as how you can use it to become less susceptible to narcissism as a whole. What is Empathy? Empathy, at its simplest, is the human capacity to relate to other people. You use empathy to help facilitate communication, for example, in order to better understand those around you. It allows you to understand what those around you are feeling in particular, allowing you to essentially step into the shoes of the other person by relating to them. Imagine for a moment that you are walking down the street and you see a homeless person sitting out in the rain. You feel sad for the person because he is stuck out in the rain and it is cold. You understand what it means to be cold and wet, something that you have been before, though maybe not within the same context, and you feel empathetic for the man. You know that he is likely suffering, and that makes you feel sad and hopeless. Effectively, you take on the feelings of the other person in order to relate to him. It serves a secondary purpose as well: It allows you to regulate your own behaviors appropriately. For example, if you can see that you are making your child upset as you yell, you are likely to stop, feel those feelings that your child is in response to your yelling, and use that knowledge to regulate your own emotions. You then make it a point tO avoid yelling because you know that it was causing problems in your relationship with your child. When you do this, you effectively are using your empathy in order to regulate yourself and your behavior, and that is a critical social skill to have. You know that the narcissist not having this ability is a major reason that he is unable to relate to those around him, and that is what made him more likely to be abusive, after all. Empathy then has two very serious functions: Communication and regulation. When you are able to communicate your emotional state to other people, you are effectively able to make sure that you are actively broadcasting out your needs. After all, emotions are closely linked to needs that must be met, so when you are having your emotions read by someone else, they are effectively learning what your needs are. If they see that you are sad, they are likely to know that you need support, simply because that is what sadness conveys—a need for support. If they see that you are afraid, they are going to know that what you need is safety, as something present around you is frightening you. Empathy then allows for nonverbal communication. It allows for people to tell others exactly what they need at that given moment without them having to ever say a word. Think of how effective that is—how long would it take if every time that you had a feeling, you had to verbally express that you were happy or sad? You would spend an awful long time talking about your constantly fluctuating emotions, especially since emotions are not particularly stable in the first place. Emotions are constantly fluctuating; sometimes, every few seconds, and empathy allows for their communication easily. Types of Empathy Empathy primarily exists in three forms that are important to understand. These three forms are cognitive, emotional, and compassionate. Each serves a slightly different purpose, but it is only when you are able to be completely empathetic that you become truly capable of using everything that empathy has to offer you. Cognitive empathy is the ability to understand emotions. It is entirely cognitive, with nothing to do with emotions or feelings. This is your ability to look at someone else, see a smile, and understand that they must be happy. You do not have to actively be feeling that happiness—you just know that is what is being felt simply because you know that smiling is a sign of happiness. This form of empathy is quite simplistic, but it has its own uses. You can still make good inferences on the emotional states of others and, therefore, their needs that they have at that moment if you are able to read how someone is feeling. This means that you can tell what is going on without really feeling compelled toward anything. Emotional empathy goes one step further. When you are able to empathize emotionally, you are able to feel the emotions of the other person. You see that person smiling, and feel the need to smile yourself as well. That smile becomes entirely contagious, and you cannot help but feel the need to smile as well. This is also incredibly important to understand—when you can empathize emotionally, you better understand the mindset of the other person. You are more likely to relate well if you can feel the other party’s feelings as well. For example, you are more likely to feel like you should relate. If you see someone that is scared and you feel that fear just by looking at the other person, you are going to be more likely to want to help. That brings us to compassionate empathy. This form of empathy is entirely about combining other forms of empathy. You are essentially taking over the cognitive and emotional empathies and recognizing what each brings to the table. In recognizing the cognitive state of the other party, you get a good idea of what is going on in the other person’s mind. You can start to piece together why they feel the way that they do. With the emotional empathy added in as well, you find that you are more compelled to help. You can feel how they feel and you want to make sure that the other people are taken care of as well. This means that you can use your empathy to ensure that anyone that you are surrounding yourself with is able to make sure their needs are met at any given time. Compassionate empathy is what should be striven for. It allows people to take care of each other, coming together to ensure that everyone’s needs get met. As a social species, we are strongly dependent upon each other to ensure that we can actually engage with other people. We are actually able to make sure that we can take care of each other simply because we actually relate to each other. When everyone feels compassionate empathy for each other, people are happy to help simply to help. They understand that if they help their neighbors, their neighbors are also likely to help them when they have a time of need as well. This is incredibly important—when you are able to rely on your neighbors, the survival of the species is more likely. Of course, nowadays, we do not need to depend on others for as much survival. You no longer have to worry about planting enough food to last all winter—you can just go to the store. You can call people and pay them money to help them. You no longer have to foster these close, neighborly relationships, but that comes at a pretty significant cost—you are no longer making those bonds that were once commonplace. Empathy to Fight Narcissism When you are trying to deal with a narcissist, you may find yourself struggling immensely. You find that it is next to impossible to approach the situation and figure out how to convince the narcissist that they are wrong —because they are hardwired to deny the idea of being wrong. They have to be right at all times, even if that comes at the cost of hurting other people. While people can try to teach the narcissist to behave and to take into consideration the feelings of others, it is not likely to get particularly far. Instead, what may be the best way to handle the narcissist is to approach the narcissist with empathy. When you approach the narcissist with an empathetic approach in mind, you are not doing it to have your actions reciprocated—you already know that the narcissist will not do that at any point in time. However, you can use your own empathy to acknowledge what is going on with the narcissist. Just because the narcissist does not empathize on his own does not mean that you cannot remove some of the threats by approaching the narcissist with an empathetic perspective. This does not even mean that you have to approach the narcissist at all—all you need to do is be willing to consider the fact that the narcissist is simply hardwired differently and that his attempts to control should not be met with anger and frustration. Think about it this way for a moment—f the narcissist were a snake, would you really fault him for biting you? The answer is probably no—you would expect it to bite you, and therefore, you would take the necessary steps to keep your own distance. This is exactly what you will be doing with empathy and your approach to narcissists. If you can identify someone as a narcissist, just leave them be. Give them their peace and their space and simply refuse to engage. If you can do this, approaching the situation pragmatically and empathetically, you remove much of the danger. The narcissist is going to have a hard time inflicting emotional harm if you have already discredited and disregarded him. What if, instead of feeling like the narcissist were truly evil, you looked at why he was the way he was? You may stop and consider that you, too, feel grandiose sometimes—such as when you are successful at something. Perhaps you felt that little flare of grandiosity when you finally escaped. This is not a bad thing—that feeling has a very good reinforcing purpose. However, the narcissist is incredibly grandiose to a fault and to a point in which it can actually be annoying and problematic. He causes issues with his grandiosity because his grandiosity is unchecked. However, is that his fault, or is that because of his personality disorder? Now, while you will never be told that you absolutely must treat the narcissist as your best friend, you should remember to empathize with him from time to time. Remember that empathizing is not the same as forgiveness, nor is it saying that you are willing to give him another chance. More than anything, it is your ability to recognize what the narcissist is capable of and why he is the way that he is. After all, if you chose to disregard your ability to empathize with the narcissist, would you be any better than he is? The narcissist does not empathize because it just does not come naturally to him. However, if it comes naturally to you, should you automatically approach the world with that empathy? Many people would say yes, that empathy is kind and compassionate and will make the world a better place. Overall, it will be up to you whether you want to use empathy with the narcissist, but it should be strongly considered. Empathy to Increase Self Awareness Beyond just to understand people, empathy is actually quite useful in the development of other social skills as well. In particular, empathy is a great segue to self awareness, and that self awareness can really help you to fight off the tendency to fall into aggressive or abusive relationships. When you are self aware, you recognize yourself. You know what your true abilities and feelings are, and that your self awareness is accurate. In particular, self awareness is necessary if you want to be able to regulate your own behaviors, thanks to knowing your limits. When you are not particularly self aware, you run into a lot of the same problems that the narcissist suffers from. You will find that you cannot regulate yourself effectively, and if you cannot understand your own feelings, you are not going to be able to understand the feelings of others, either. However, if you already have a base of being highly empathetic, you can try to use that empathy to really help you understand other people as well. If you can see what someone else’s body, language is saying. Ultimately, your self awareness and ability to empathize are far closer related than you may have thought, and the more empathy you have, the more likely you are to make it a point to regulate what you are saying. That regulation of understanding what is going on is what will help you with the development of self awareness. If you know that your actions are upsetting other people, for example, you are coming across in a way that is clearly inappropriate in the eyes of other people. This means that other people are entirely unhappy with how you are presenting yourself, and you will need to figure out why. Your empathy then allows you to start figuring out why they were unhappy. What did you do that caused it? If you see that in particular, people seem to be annoyed with your insistence to do something a certain way, you could assume that your desire to complete whatever it was is the problem. Perhaps you were coming across as pushy. Now, you are able to acknowledge that the people were annoyed with you, and then figure out exactly why. When you are aware of what you are doing and how it is impacting those around you, you are far more likely to be cautious in the future. You will then be more self aware. Effectively, then, self awareness is regulated by empathy, and that makes the two quite powerful when used in tandem. Empathy to Build Self Esteem Just as empathy and self awareness are closely related, you must also be able to acknowledge the fact that empathy and self esteem share a similar bond. Self esteem is critical to how we see ourselves. Your own self esteem is largely the way that you view yourself in the world. Are you happy with who you are, or do you feel like something about your personality is inherently flawed? Do you feel like your ability to help other people is so incredibly stunted that you are not particularly valuable, or do you think that you are a good person? Think about self esteem for a moment and what the words may mean. You are literally creating an estimate of yourself. You are effectively defining your value, as seen in your own eyes. If you have a high self esteem, or a healthy self esteem, you view yourself quite positively. Some people’s self esteem may be too high, such as the narcissist—but in moderation, self esteem is critical to being successful in the world around you. If you have a healthy self esteem, you have your own boundaries and limits for yourself. You are effectively able to say that you respect yourself and put a line on where that respect is. You can tell what you think about yourself by looking at that line. Low self esteem, however, implies that your image of yourself is quite negative. You feel like the image that you present is problematic or flawed, or you feel like the person that you are is inherently negative. When you have a low self esteem, you do not trust yourself. You do not think that the person that you are is worthy of respect or love, or you may even feel like you are a waste of space and time in the world. Self esteem is one of those traits that you want in moderation in order to be healthy, and empathy can help you achieve exactly that. Consider, for a moment, the effect of mutual empathy. For example, imagine that you and your friend are able to empathize with each other. You are able to respect each other and show each other how much you care about each other. You can make sure that you are able to show the other person your own assessment of their own worth. You value them, and you are able to show that through relating to their feelings. The more you empathize with someone, the more you value who they are, what they like, and how you see them. Now, if you just empathized with your friend, how do you think that made him feel? The answer is that he probably felt pretty good—he was justified by you acknowledging his position and his own feelings, and that was something that he truly appreciated. You effectively showed him that he cared, and in response, he was happier than he had been in a while. Now, consider that the empathy is mutual—he empathized with you when you were talking about the problem with the narcissist that you have recently escaped from. You feel validated and supported, as well. When you feel like people validate and support you, you feel like other people are hearing who you are and actually caring about what you are saying. This means that you are able to see that other people are, in fact, acknowledging you, your feelings, and your likes and dislikes. You are seeing that, unlike how the narcissist told you, you do have inherent value. The narcissist may have damaged your self esteem by refusing to acknowledge your values and emotions, but you can begin to heal from that. You can draw from the empathy of others to begin to heal those wounds. Empathy reminds you that others in the world do, in fact, care about you. They do care what you think about the world. They do care how you are feeling and whether you can claim that all of your needs have been met. They want to ensure that you are able to take care of yourself, and they are able to help. If even random strangers that you do not know can empathize with you, then what does that tell you? It tells you that your self esteem should improve. It tells you that your narcissistic ex’s attempts to belittle you and bring you down were little more than tools to keep you easily subdued, and without the narcissist present, you should be willing to acknowledge this. This means then that without the narcissist to continue bringing you down you should be able to begin healing more and more. You can make sure that you are actually beginning to feel better, and acknowledging that you do have an inherent value that other people see. Empathy will remind you to heal that inherent value. It will help that damaged; wilted self esteem begin to blossom and flourish once more, nourished upon the love and empathy from other people. If other people can see your value without knowing you, then you must have some. Chapter 12: Protecting Yourself Against Future Abuse Finally, you have made it—this is the last chapter within the book. Congratulations on your journey, and good luck as you begin to enter the chapter dedicated to bettering yourself! While it is in no way your fault that you were abused and manipulated, you may be wondering what you can do in the future in order to avoid finding yourself victimized again. The answer is that there is no true way to never be the victim of an abusive relationship again unless you simply never get into a relationship. However, that is an incredibly unhealthy way to live life. People crave the closeness and intimacy of their relationships, and you deserve to acknowledge that need, even if it is tough to do so. While you cannot exactly create a foolproof guard against abuse, what you can do is make sure that you have chosen a way to sort of shield yourself. You can armor yourself into becoming someone who is a less attractive target for emotional and narcissistic abuse. Think for a moment about the narcissist’s favorite target—how many of those traits did you have? If I had to guess, I would say that you actually had several—and that is okay. However, you will need to make sure that you are actively bettering yourself in order to remain as protected as you can be. If you lack self confidence, learning to be confident is the natural next step. If you feel like the problem is something inherent with you, you may find benefit from therapy. You may decide to develop your own emotional intelligence in an attempt to better protect yourself in the future, or you may create affirmations to help you build up some self esteem and self worth. No matter what you choose to do, you will be able to acknowledge that you are bettering yourself in some way to help yourself remain safe in the future. As you read through this chapter, do not feel like you are limited to what is discussed. If you want to build confidence, but have a different method that you would like to use, then go for it. Trust yourself and your own judgment. After all, you are your own free person now, and you can choose what you will do and where you will do it. You do not need the permission of a book to make sure that you can get the build up and protection that you want! Building Confidence Let’s start by defining confidence once more—it is your ability to feel like you can rely on yourself. If you are confident, you feel like you are trustworthy and that you will protect yourself in some way. You will effectively make sure that you are able to trust your own judgment if you are confident, allowing you to resist the urge to fall for any future gaslighting attempts. Remember, the reason that you were likely so susceptible to many of the abuse tactics was a lack of confidence. That confidence is perhaps your greatest shield that will protect you from an emotional manipulator. Because confidence will mean that you trust yourself, your thoughts, and your perceptions inherently, you remove the power of being able to convince you that you are wrong. The narcissist needs someone that is not particularly confident specifically because keeping someone that is not particularly confident is keeping someone who is very easily manipulated and controlled. This means that the best targets are those without the confidence to trust themselves and respect themselves to leave any sort of abusive situation. When you want to develop your own confidence, you are effectively going to be teaching yourself to trust your judgment. This means that you will be doing several little trust exercises to ensure that you are actually able to remain safe. Thankfully, confidence is not fixed—it is a skill that you can develop over time through practice. It will be a matter of finding aspects of life that will help to bring you confidence. Do you like sports? Perhaps you join a martial arts class aimed toward domestic abuse survivors to help foster a sense of self confidence. Do you like video games? Pick a new one and get good at it. No matter what you do, the important part is that you must choose something to dedicate yourself to doing, allow yourself to follow through, and then make sure that you acknowledge to yourself that you did do whatever it was that you set out to do. Over time, you will find that your confidence will build. You may find that social interactions with people grow easier because you are not as ashamed of yourself. You may do better at job interviews because you feel better about who you are, or that you have a higher value than before. No matter the technique that you are going to use, just make sure that you stick to it and continue to acknowledge yourself and your abilities over time. All you will need to do is ensure that you are able to be the person that you are trying to be. Putting in that effort and actively striving to be the best will help you see the best results. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy If you were easily victimized by the manipulator or the narcissist, it may be worth spending some time in cognitive behavioral therapy. In particular, this therapy is quite skilled at making sure that you are able to protect yourself. You will be able to learn several skills that will be able to help you be as successful as you desire to be. In particular, CBT focuses on how to teach you how to become able to cope with any problem that you face. Is your self esteem low? With CBT, you can learn to identify why your self esteem is slow in the first place and then figure out how to begin restructuring those thoughts into something that is more productive, beneficial to everyone, and capable of helping you become happier. CBT is all about cognitive restructuring, figuring out how to identify those thoughts that pose the biggest challenges to us and then becoming capable of correcting them in order to ensure that we are better in general. Think about the difference between CBT and a traditional therapy for a moment—a traditional psychotherapy is going to focus on you being able to talk through your problems. It may help you solve that one problem that has been driving you insane, but is it really going to make sure that you are actually fully capable of solving problems on its own? No, it won’t. CBT seeks to teach all sorts of different coping mechanisms that can be used to help better yourself. You will have techniques for defeating phobias and for learning how to change your thoughts. You will learn how to cope with stress and how to make yourself that much stronger of a person. You will be able to do it all, thanks to the fact that you will be able to learn skills that are vague enough to be used in nearly any setting. That is the magic of CBT and why it is so effective—it is tool based. All you will do is figure out how to use the tools that will help you get through the process of coping with stress, and that is powerful. Think of the expression of being able to teach a man to fish and feeding him for a lifetime. CBT is effectively teaching you to fish, and you will be able to reuse them over and over again. So long as you are willing to continue using those techniques, you will find that you are able to continue to see effects over and over again. Keep in mind that there is no shame or harm in therapy. You should never be made to feel like you are less than capable because you have gotten help coping with your problems. In fact, being willing to admit that you need help is far more admirable than refusing to ever go. If you were willing to put in the effort with your own skills, learning to cope with your own problems, you deserve that recognition. Even better, doing so will help you protect yourself from the narcissist once and for all. You will be able to patch up all of those traits that that narcissist enjoys, so you are not so susceptible. You will be able to tell yourself that you can develop self esteem. You will be able to figure out your codependency problem. You will be able to figure out exactly why you were so willing to put up with all of that abuse for so long and how you can finally overcome it. You will learn how to figure out the best way to boost your self confidence and self esteem, as well as how to use your empathy effectively, all with the help of this therapy that you may otherwise have chosen to avoid out of fear of stigma. Emotional Intelligence One other skillset that may be beneficial to protecting yourself as well is learning to be emotionally intelligent. Emotional intelligence is defined as the ability to understand and identify your own emotions, as well as regulate them. You will also be able to identify and regulate the feelings of other people as well with this skillset. In particular, those who use emotional intelligence recognize that there are four distinct skillsets that go into it: There is the skillset of self awareness, the skillset of self regulation, the skillset of social awareness, and the skillset of relationship management. Each of these are useful in their own different ways, but when all four come together, you can create skilled leaders that are empathetic, persuasive, well liked, and confident. Self awareness in emotional intelligence is a focus on how to understand your own emotions and abilities. You will effectively look at how you are behaving and feeling. You will also be taking a closer look at how accurately you can identify your strengths and weaknesses. You need to be able to understand your weaknesses and strengths if you ever hope to better yourself and make sure that you know what you are capable of. When you know what you are capable of, you can make only the commitments that you know that you can do, and if you know where you struggle, you can ask for help without worrying about how you will fail if you attempt to actually go through with trying to work within your weaknesses. Self regulation focuses on your ability to control yourself. You will be understanding how to avoid responding to those emotional impulses that you feel that push you toward behaviors that would otherwise be problematic, such as actively making it a point to avoid yelling, despite wanting to yell incredibly badly. When you can self regulate, you avoid hurting other people through carelessness. Social awareness refers to your ability to empathize with other people and understand the emotions of other people. When you are able to empathize with other people, you can directly understand what they are feeling and thinking, which provides valuable insight to needs and motivations. With your ability to empathize in emotional intelligence, you are able to begin figuring out how to regulate the behaviors of others as well. When you learn to regulate the behaviors of others as well, you are learning the skill of relationship management. You are learning to accurately determine what people are capable of, see how they interact with other people, and figure out how they are able to best benefit everyone involved. Effectively, then, you are able to begin to influence the behaviors of others with ease as well. You do this through watching how your own behaviors influence the emotional states of others in order to figure out the best approach. Developing emotional intelligence does not need to be difficult—all it takes is some patience and willing to read books, not unlike this one. If you think that you could benefit from emotional intelligence, it is a highly recommended technique and segues away from understanding abuse and the reasons behind abuse. Affirmations Finally, the last technique that you will be given to help yourself is how to create an affirmation. This is an incredibly common technique that can be used to help you change your mindset little by little. When you use an affirmation, you will effectively be able to make sure that you can tell yourself something short that reminds you to change the way that you are thinking in that moment. Commonly used to combat negative thoughts, you may find this particularly useful if the narcissist has really done a number on your self worth. To create an affirmation, you must simply follow three specific rules: It must be positive, it must be personal, and it must be present tense. Let’s go over why each of these points are important: When you make a positive affirmation, you are making sure that it is keeping you in the right mindset. After so long being talked to in the negative by the narcissist, it is time to break away once and for all. This means that you will need to figure out how best to word whatever you wish in positives. For example, if you want to not be so negative, you may instead write your affirmation to focus on thinking positively instead. When you make a personal affirmation, you make sure that it is something that you have control over. You can control yourself, so you want to make sure that your affirmation is aimed toward yourself. When it is, you can ensure that it is something that you can regulate effectively enough. For example, you can tell yourself that you are going to think positive thoughts, but you cannot tell yourself that you will make the narcissist think positively. This is exactly why your affirmation has to be personal—so you can regulate it. Finally, when you make sure that your affirmation is present tense, you are asserting that it is true right at that moment. If it were worded in the future tense, you could arguably say that you would not start to work on it until sometime in the future, meaning that it is not actually true that moment, and likewise, if it were oriented in the past tense, you could deny that it was actually true right at that minute. For that reason, it must be present tense. So now, you have three requirements: it must be personal, positive, and present tense. To figure out your affirmation, figure out first what you want. If you want to feel more confident, for example, you may set up so you repeat notes of positivity to yourself. You tell yourself that you are good enough exactly the way you are with a statement such as, “I am happy with who I am today.” Notice how it is present tense, it is positive, and it is personal. This means that it is effective. From there, the affirmation is then used any time you feel like you need a little extra push toward the positive mindset you are trying to maintain. If you are trying to keep that positivity, you may make sure that it is repeated any time you start to doubt yourself. Any time that you feel like you are less than thrilled with yourself, you remind yourself that you are happy with the you that you are that day. On top of that, affirmations are particularly effective when they are used on the regular while you are doing something else habitual. Maybe you repeat your affirmation every time you buckle your seatbelt in the car or every time that you stop for water throughout the day. In repeating your affirmation throughout the day, you make yourself more likely to finally internalize and believe it over time. Just as the narcissist was able to insert negative thoughts into your own mind with repetition, you can create your own positive thoughts with your own repetition as well.
